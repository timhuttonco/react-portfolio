### A Year In Books - 2019

Firstly, the bad news. This list contains a paltry amount of just 16 books which, I know, over the course of a year is hardly a grand effort. The good news? Guess whose wife got them a Kindle this Christmas! One can only hope that this means the list for next year is larger. Also, I know the photo is the same as last year, but a) it's a good photo and b) no-one (understandably) took a photo of me reading this year. Given that most of my reading is done while commuting, that is probably a good thing.

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2S4PTZH" title="I Am Pilgrim" target="_blank" id="IAmPilgrim">I Am Pilgrim - Terry Hayes:</a> The first book of the year happens to be the best book that I have read this year. Don't worry, the list isn't going to get worse from here, but this was my personal favourite. This book was suggested to me by a colleague and I am very thankful for the recommendation. A mixture of a murder/spy thriller, it is a long read (912 pages to be precise) but entirely worth the effort. The book combines five different events that are all interlinked and keeps you on the edge throughout. There is a follow up called <a href="https://amzn.to/2SPFeWQ" title="Year of the Locust" target="_blank">Year of the Locust</a> that was due out during 2019 but has now been pushed back until September 2020 to my huge disappointment.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2S4DvZL" title="Blockchain Revolution" target="_blank" id="BlockchainRevolution">Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies is Changing the World - Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott:</a> Late 2018/early 2019 saw a huge boom in the popularity of Blockchain, mostly thanks to a sudden surge in usage of Bitcoin. With this in mind (and with every other post on LinkedIn talking about companies using Blockchain and "why your company should"), I decided to dive in and try and educate myself on the subject. While Blockchain Revolution does help give a good initial understanding about how Blockchain works, it reads a little like a cult guide, talking about nothing but the positives of Blockchain and why every single industry you can think of should use it, without touching on the negatives or the better options out there. An interesting read, but far too one-sided to actually provide a good enough education on the matter.</a></p>

<a href="https://amzn.to/2BEoW9P" title="Disrupted" target="_blank" id="Disrupted"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2BEoW9P">Disrupted: Ludicrous Misadventures in the Tech Start-up Bubble - Dan Lyons:</a> As someone who has worked in a start-up for five years, I have seen more than enough of the ups and downs which come with being part of a growing company. My OneNote is full of notes from the last few years that I am confident at some point would make a good book, if only I had the motivation (and writing ability) to create an entertaining read. There are a few books out there by people who have been involved in start-ups, and Disrupted is an honest memoir by Dan Lyons about his time at <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" title="Hubspot">Hubspot</a>. While Lyons does highlight some of the ridiculousness of the start-up culture, it does come across as a bit of a "bitter old man" diary of someone who thinks that offices should not have changed or be a fun place to work, seeming to be genuinely angered by an office having a bean bag in it. That being said, if you have worked in a start-up, there will certainly be moments throughout this read that will have you laughing at similar stories that you have encountered, or rolling your eyes for the same reason.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SFCwnV" title="F You Very Much" target="_blank" id="FYouVeryMuch"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SFCwnV">F*** You Very Much: The surprising truth about why people are so rude - Danny Wallace:</a> I have always been a big fan of anything by Danny Wallace, be it <a href="https://amzn.to/370gxeM" target="_blank" title="Yes Man">Yes Man</a> or his column in Shortlist magazine, so was very keen to read his latest work. F You Very Much is a brilliant take on the reasons why people may be rude, including some hilarious stories from his own experience, mixed in with some fascinating interviews with neuroscientists, psychologists, and even NASA scientists. 

<a href="https://amzn.to/2S7OQZg" title="The President Is Missing" target="_blank" id="ThePresidentIsMissing"><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2S7OQZg">The President Is Missing - James Patterson and Bill Clinton:</a> Following on from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2S4PTZH" title="I Am Pilgrim" target="_blank">I Am Pilgrim</a> earlier in the year, I decided to make use of Amazon's recommendations and read The President Is Missing, the first novel featuring Bill Clinton. The story is pretty tense and nail-biting, keeping you on the edge, however does "drag on" a little bit, while also feeling a little bit farcical as to whether any of the story could actually happen to a sitting President. That being said, I would still recommend for those who enjoy a thriller.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2DJm2kw" title="Hello World" target="_blank" id="HelloWorld"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DJm2kw">Hello World: How to be Human in the Age of the Machine - Hannah Fry:</a> I had been recommended Hannah Fry's Hello World a few times and was not disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Much in the same vain as Who Can You Trust by Rachel Botsman and, of course, The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil, Fry touches on algorithms and how they affect our day to day life, along with the potential long-term issues of these. The upside of this read is that it feels like it is suitable to any knowledge level, giving clear and detailed explanations of all of the topics covered, before going much more in depth and posing some interesting questions. Fry also presented the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b00pmbqq/royal-institution-christmas-lectures" target="_blank" title="Royal Institution Christmas Lectures">Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> this year which I would highly recommend watching.

<a href="https://amzn.to/35g69Ol" title="The Secret Barrister" target="_blank" id="SecretBarrister"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/35g69Ol">The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It's Broken:</a> A book that feels like it fits in the same category as Adam Kay's <a href="https://amzn.to/38bbF6s" target="blank" title="This Is Going To Hurt">This Is Going To Hurt</a>, lifting the lid on institutions that are key to our day-to-day lives that we just assume will always work in our favour. The Secret Barrister does provide some rather worrying tales of fascinating cases, however these are just snippets of a book which reads much more like a rant about the shortcomings of the justice system and can be hard to read in some parts.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2N6r5kH" title="The Smartest Guys in the Room" target="_blank" id="SmartestGuysInTheRoom"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2N6r5kH">The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron - Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind:</a> Having read John Carreyrou's fantastic <a href="https://amzn.to/30vb9Oe" target="_blank" title="Bad Blood">Bad Blood</a> last year, I spent a while looking for another good read about businesses that have got it wrong in fascinating circumstances, and The Smartest Guys in the Room certainly falls into that category. I have to be honest, I had never actually heard about the Enron case before reading this and therefore was unaware of how it would end. Similar to Bad Blood, this reads like a thriller throughout, while also leaving you open-mouthed at some of the situations that played out for what was a huge company at the time. Thanks to interviews with those who worked there during the time, it gives a real insight into just how crazy the situation was and how it all came crashing down.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MOwa0Q" title="Black Edge" target="_blank" id="BlackEdge"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MOwa0Q">Black Edge: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall Street - Sheelah Kolhatkar:</a> A book that fits in a similar category to The Smartest Guys In The Room, this looks at the rise of Steven A. Cohen and how he changed the face of how Wall Street worked, even if it was done using questionable methods, along with how his company came to be part of the largest insider trading investigation in history. Kolhatkar's book gives a really interesting view from both sides of the fence, with interviews from those who worked for Cohen and those who were investigating him. An enjoyable read, not as thrilling as The Smartest Guys in the Room, but certainly one that will keep you interested.

<a href="https://amzn.to/35fIbT7" title="How to Be a Footballer" target="_blank" id="petercrouch"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/35fIbT7">How to Be a Footballer - Peter Crouch:</a> I had been listening to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads" title="That Peter Crouch Podcast" target="_blank">That Peter Crouch Podcast</a> for a while before deciding to read this, a hilarious podcast full of funny stories throughout Crouch's playing career. The book is just as funny and open as the podcast, with some brilliant stories that will have you laughing throughout in what is a very easy and quick read, particularly for any football fan. That being said, if you have listened to the podcast already, you will find yourself reading quite a few stories that you will have already heard.

<a href="https://amzn.to/37u056e" title="Humans" target="_blank" id="Humans"><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/37u056e">Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up - Tom Phillips:</a> I have been meaning to read Yuval Noah Harari's <a href="https://amzn.to/2RD97Yv" target="_blank" title="Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind">Sapiens</a> for a while now without getting around to it. I then stumbled across this book by Tom Phillips which is essentially a parody of Harari's book and is a hilarious take on all of the stupid things that we have done as a species throughout the years. Guaranteed to make you laugh (and roll your eyes) throughout.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2ua6pBn" title="Billion Dollar Whale" target="_blank" id="BillionDollarWhale"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ua6pBn">Billion Dollar Whale: the man who fooled Wall Street, Hollywood, and the world - Tom Wright:</a> The next book on my list followed a similar theme to The Smartest Guys In The Room and Black Edge, in a story that I had not heard of before, looking at how Malaysian Jho Low pulled off "one of the biggest heists in history", stealing over $5 billion and using it to fund a party lifestyle. I was also completely unaware that The Wolf of Wall Street movie had been funded predominantly by money that had been stolen by this con artist. The book looks at how Low built his fortune through fraudulent schemes, and how the authorities worked to bring him down in another interesting read. Similar to Black Edge, however, it will leave you utterly perplexed by how these people get away with it, even for a short period of time.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SOAm4v" title="Humble Pi" target="_blank" id="HumblePi"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SOAm4v">Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors - Matt Parker:</a> Matt Parker labels himself as a mathematician and comedian and was a hilarious part of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b00pmbqq/royal-institution-christmas-lectures" target="_blank" title="Royal Institution Christmas Lectures">Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> with Hannah Fry last year. Parker brought that humour to his second book which is a fantastic take on comedy math errors that have taken place over the years. Even someone with limited mathematical knowledge (such as myself) can easily enjoy this book, containing funny and interesting stories; even a chapter about bridges can keep one entertained! A book in similar guise to Randall Munroe's <a href="https://amzn.to/2RcKpyV" target="_blank" title="What If">What If?</a>, this is amusingly written and very enjoyable.

<a href="https://amzn.to/37shDQ0" title="Tales from the Secret Footballer" target="_blank" id="SecretFootballer"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/37shDQ0">Tales from the Secret Footballer:</a> Every now and then I decide to divert my attention from books that will actually educate me and read a football book. It is a terrible habit, but one that I doubt I will change any time soon. I have been aware of the Secret Footballer for a few years now, without ever being an avid reader of their newspaper columns, but decided to give this book a read and wish I had not done so. Given the anonymous nature of the book, it is often difficult to take the writer seriously, particularly with the arrogance that they use to portray themselves. Don't get me wrong, there are some funny and surprising stories within this which may keep one entertained, but the way the writer portrays themselves as a footballing deity makes this one difficult to stay interested in.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MNtPTG" title="48 Hours" target="_blank" id="48Hours"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MNtPTG">48 Hours: A City of London Thriller - J Jackson Bentley:</a> 48 Hours is exactly what it is described as, "A City of London Thriller". A large part of the storyline is set in Greenwich, which kept this one interesting for me as I was fairly familiar with the locations and streets used throughout. Bentley's second novel is a real thriller, keeping you entertained throughout with a storyline about a number of characters being blackmailed and threatened with death if they do not follow orders. One downside is the unnecessary romantic addition to the tale, but I can let that slide as it does not take up too much of the book. However, The best bit? It's completely free for those with a Kindle, as is the follow up, <a href="https://amzn.to/2TLNuHS" target="_blank" title="Chameleon">Chameleon</a>, which I have yet to read but will certainly be doing very soon.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SOC1Hh" title="Money" target="_blank" id="Money"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SOC1Hh">Money: A User’s Guide - Laura Whateley:</a> To be completely honest, I have never been very good with money (he says despite having a mortgage). Laura Whateley delivers a thorough and easy to follow guide on what to do with your money and what to look out for when using it. It is a book I wish I had read at the age of 18 and would urge almost anyone to do so. Topics such as rent, mortgages, savings, pensions and investments are all covered, along with how to deal with money worries. A fairly quick read that will make you very well informed and one that you will definitely not regret.
