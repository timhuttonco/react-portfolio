### The Closest I'll Come to a PhD: Harriet Lowe's PhD Eye Tracking Website

One of my proudest and most enjoyable projects came when I was able to work with my fiancée, <a href="https://harrietllowe.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" title="Harriet Lowe">Harriet Lowe</a>, to build a website that was part of her PhD eye-tracking study at the <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/" title="University of Greenwich" target="_blank">University of Greenwich</a>.

The website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP, and was designed to be used via a <a href="https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/tobii-pro-tx300/" target="_blank" title="Tobii Pro TX300 eye tracker">Tobii Pro TX300 eye tracker</a>, which ran the website through Internet Explorer, adding its own level of complexity to proceedings.

Participants were presented with a range of sentences in French or Italian, depending on the language that they were currently studying, while some sentences were also accompanied by images and audio.

For the sentences that accompanied images, the study used a visual-world paradigm; where participants were first presented with a question in English, and subsequently with audio in French or Italian simultaneously with two visual scenes. The participants were required to select the image that correctly corresponded with the audio sentence.

Time to click was recorded for these sentences as part of the data collection. This was done so by using session storage to store the time at which the images were shown, before seperately storing the time of the click, and subtracting the former from the latter to calculate the 'time to click', before collating this throughout the study for each sentence, and emailing the results to the researcher upon completion.

Data collection of the eye-tracking study is now complete, and Harriet is currently writing up the results, with her PhD due to be submitted in early 2019.
