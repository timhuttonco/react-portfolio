### Calcio In Italia - Travelling from the UK to Italy to watch football: A Guide
Now for something a little bit different on the writing front. I recently had the privilege of ticking off an item from the bucket list and spent a weekend in Milan watching <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A</a>. It took quite a bit of research and last minute adjustments (more on that later), but in the end we managed to see <a href="https://www.inter.it/en" title="Inter Milan" target="_blank">Inter Milan</a> v <a href="https://www.asroma.com/en" title="AS Roma" target="_blank">Roma</a> at San Siro, and <a href="https://en.atalanta.it/" title="Atalanta" target="_blank">Atalanta</a> v <a href="https://www.uslecce.it/" title="Lecce" target="_blank">Lecce</a> at the Gewiss Stadium on the same day. 

Whilst sitting in London on a rainy day and cheering myself up by researching my next Calcio trip, I wanted to share my thoughts, tips, and learnings to help anyone thinking of travelling to Italy to watch football.

<h4>When To Go</h4>
The first thing to consider during the planning phase is when you are going to go. This might sound like an obvious point, but if you were to look at the <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en/serie-a" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A fixtures</a> for a date a few months from now, you will likely see that every game is listed as being played on the Sunday of that gameweek, either with an 8pm kick-off, or with the kick-off marked as “TBD”. This is because <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A</a> releases the kick-off dates and times in batches throughout the season - which can make planning flights and hotels a bit difficult.

Thankfully, you can get a bit of a headstart on your planning as <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A</a> have confirmed the dates when matchdays will have their dates and times confirmed. These dates can be found below and <a href="https://onefootball.com/en/news/serie-a-promise-confirmation-of-kick-off-times-early-in-2025-26-41253952" title="Serie A promise confirmation of kick-off times early in 2025-26" target="_blank">here</a>.

* Matchday 1 to 3 – confirmed 30th June 2025
* Matchday 4 to 12 – confirmed 5th September 2025
* Matchday 13 to 22 – confirmed 10th October 2025
* Matchday 23 to 24 – confirmed 19th December 2025
* Matchday 25 to 27 – confirmed 30th January 2026
* Matchday 28 to 30 – confirmed 27th February 2026
* Matchday 31 to 33 – confirmed 20th March 2026
* Matchday 34 to 36 – confirmed 17th April 2026
* Matchday 37 – confirmed 11th May 2026
* Matchday 38 – confirmed 18th May 2026

Now, in terms of things to note on dates and times. Typically, but not always, the “big” game of a weekend will be the primetime television slot of 20:45 (Italian time), apart from the weekend before <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/" title="UEFA Champions League" target="_blank">Champions League</a> fixtures, hence why Juventus v Inter Milan is the 18:00 kick-off on Saturday in matchday 3 this season.

The bigger teams will also not usually play on Friday or Monday nights, however, there will be the odd occasion where this is the case. Depending on when you are looking to go, my advice would be to look at booking a matchday towards the end of a “bracket”. For example, match day 22 takes place on 25th January, with the fixture dates and kick-off times confirmed on 10th October, giving you lots of time to book travel and accommodation. It is also worth being aware that the fixture release “brackets” are much shorter towards the end of the season, as <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A</a> typically makes their television choices based on what teams still have things to play for at the business end of the campaign.

<h4>Where To Go</h4>
The answer to this question all depends on the type of trip that you are looking to do. If you’re simply looking to do a particular stadium, club or game, then the recommendation is, of course, to stay in that city, especially on matchday as you will be really able to get a feel for the atmosphere. If you are looking at doing a particular club or ground, <a href="https://calcioengland.com/category/calcio-travel-notes/" title="Calcio England Travel Notes" target="_blank">Calcio England</a> have created brilliant guides for a number of grounds.

However, if you are looking to do multiple games in a weekend (or even multiple games in a day as we serendipitously managed), then you need to choose carefully where to base yourself.

For our trip we decided to base ourselves in Milan, mainly because we wanted to visit San Siro, there are plenty of flights from the UK and also because it would give us the opportunity to travel to other stadiums as well if the kick-off Gods were kind to us. By train from Milan you can get to Como in 40 minutes, Bergamo for Atalanta in 50 minutes, Turin in an hour, along with Verona in 70 minutes and Bologna in a similar time.

The further south you go, the more scattered the teams become, so it is worth bearing in mind when planning which games you want to see. 

<h4>How To Buy Tickets</h4>
One crucial aspect to note is the ticket release schedule. For the larger, more popular teams in <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A</a> (like <a href="https://www.juventus.com/en/" title="Juventus" target="_blank">Juventus</a>, <a href="https://www.inter.it/en" title="Inter Milan" target="_blank">Inter Milan</a>, <a href="https://www.acmilan.com/en" title="AC Milan" target="_blank">AC Milan</a>, <a href="https://www.asroma.com/en" title="AS Roma" target="_blank">Roma</a>, and <a href="https://sscnapoli.it/en/" title="Napoli" target="_blank">Napoli</a>), tickets often go on sale several weeks in advance, sometimes even before the exact kick-off times are finalised. This is particularly important if you're hoping to snag cheaper tickets (we bagged both Inter and Juventus tickets for €25) or those in or near to the “ultras” section, as these tend to sell out quickly. <a href="https://comofootball.com/en/matches-and-tickets/" title="Como 1907" target="_blank">Como</a> and <a href="https://www.veneziafc.it/en" title="Venezia" target="_blank">Venezia</a> also have very small grounds, meaning tickets go quickly (though Como often has hundreds of hospitality tickets available, albeit priced in the hundreds). Conversely, some other teams might only release tickets a week or two before the game, and sometimes without much prior announcement, so it's essential to keep a close eye on their official club websites.

When it comes to purchasing, the most reliable route is always through the official club websites. While some clubs might direct you to third-party ticketing platforms, you can generally access these sites via direct links on the club's own ticketing section. Many of these official and linked sites do offer an English language option, which can significantly simplify the process for British fans. However, be prepared for instances where English might not be available. A vital point to remember is that Italian football tickets are often "nominal", meaning they are tied to the individual attending. You'll need to provide the full names of all attendees during the purchase process. On match days, security checks are common, we were checked for both games that we attended, and you will be asked to present ID (a UK passport or driving licence will suffice) that matches the name on your ticket. Therefore, ensure you have all full names to hand when booking and bring your corresponding ID to the stadium.

<h6><i>A Note On Reselling Platforms</i></h6>
I have to confess that we flirted with the idea of buying from a reseller but didn’t end up going through with it as we managed to get tickets through official means so I cannot comment much on that process; however, I am aware of a few people who have done so without any issues. What I will say is that we also had tickets to a Juventus game that we were able to resell, and when uploading my tickets these were scrutinised very carefully and claimed to be manually checked, so that process definitely gave me some confidence. However, as always with reselling platforms, you should exercise caution.

<h6><i>A Few Notes On Inside The Stadium</i></h6>
Firstly, we were able to use our cards to make purchases inside both of the grounds that we attended, but I would always recommend having a small amount of cash to hand just in case.

Wearing “colours” is very common in Italy, so if you happen to buy a shirt of the team you are supporting then you are highly encouraged to wear it - we even saw quite a few Roma shirts around us in the Inter section at the game we attended, although I would err on the side of caution when wearing "away" colours if you are sitting anywhere near the ultras.

Finally, and probably most importantly for British supporters, you are allowed to take alcohol to your seats in Italian stadiums, a far cry from leaving the rest of your drink to race to your seat before kick-off!

<h4>How To Get Around</h4>
As mentioned above, you can travel between cities relatively easily in Italy by train. For those who enjoy familiarity, you’ll be pleased to know that you can buy Italian train tickets on <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/trains/italy" title="Trainline" target="_blank">Trainline</a>.

Be aware that football stadiums in Italy are rarely directly next to the city's main (Centrale) train station, so you'll need to factor in additional travel via metro, bus, taxi or even walking to reach the ground. For instance, Milan's San Siro is about 6km from Milan Centrale and best reached by metro, while Juventus's stadium in Turin is around 5km from Turin's Centrale station, typically requiring a bus on match days. 

If your schedule allows for it, you can manage two games in a single day like we did; attending Inter's 15:00 kick-off at San Siro, leisurely returning to Milano Centrale, catching a train to Bergamo, and arriving at Gewiss Stadium 5 minutes before the 20:45 kick-off after a 30 minute walk.

For longer distances, Italy is also well-connected by internal flights, but remember to account for travel time to and from each airport. If you are travelling between cities, it is worth factoring in what to do with your luggage, as stadiums typically won’t allow you to bring bags in. Some stations will have left luggage facilities, or alternatively, you can plan your timings well enough to be able to leave your belongings in your relevant accommodation. 

<h4>A Summary Of Our Italian Football Trip</h4>
Since you have got this far it feels apt to share how our weekend went, particularly as it was far from straightforward. Towards the end of winter, we decided that we would go to Italy before the end of the season, and having decided to make Milan our base, chose gameweek 34 due to the fact that Como, Verona, Atalanta, Inter and Juve were all at home, giving us confidence that when the kick-off times were released, we would be able to see more than one game that weekend - the optimistic side of me even flirting with the idea of attending three games.

Our main objective was to attend Inter v Roma at San Siro, and seeing that they had a Coppa Italia semi-final one side of the weekend and potentially a Champions League semi-final the other side, we were reasonably confident that at the very least we would be able to watch Inter that weekend. With that in mind, we purchased very early flights for Saturday morning, returning on Monday.

When the fixtures were eventually released, our hopes of attending three games were dashed as Atalanta were placed on the Friday night and Verona on the Monday night. However, Inter v Roma was scheduled for the Saturday 18:00 kick-off, and Juventus v Monza was scheduled for Sunday at 18:00. Como v Genoa was also scheduled for the Saturday at 15:00, meaning it would not be possible to attend that and Inter on the same day. But, we were happy with our lot and got tickets for Inter and Juve, and sorted an <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/" title="AirBnB" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> in Milan for the Saturday night, purchase trains from Milan to Turin and an <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/" title="AirBnB" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> for the Sunday night, with trains back to Milan on the Monday for our flight.

However, fortune would very much go against us as on the Monday before we were due to fly out, <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-04/pope-francis-dies-on-easter-monday-aged-88.html" title="Pope Francis has died on Easter Monday aged 88" target="_blank">Pope Francis sadly passed away</a>, leaving Italy in mourning and resulting in all <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cx20gmvydzzo" title="Serie A games postponed after death of Pope Francis" target="_blank">football fixtures being cancelled</a> that day. This was just the start of our panic as we became greatly concerned that our weekend plans would go up in flames (granted, there were far more important things going on in the world at that time).

Those Monday games were <a href="https://football-italia.net/serie-a-confirm-dates-of-postponed-games/" title="Official: Serie A confirm dates of postponed Juventus, Lazio and Fiorentina fixtures" target="_blank">moved to Wednesday</a>, and the Coppa Italia semi-finals on the Wednesday and Thursday were confirmed to still go ahead, which reassured us that the weekend would still go ahead as planned. Alas, the universe had other ideas as the funeral of Pope Francis was <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-04/the-funeral-celebration-of-pope-francis-on-saturday.html" title="The celebration of Pope Francis' funeral on Saturday" target="_blank">confirmed for the Saturday</a>, which we immediately knew would mean a day of national mourning. Cue constant <a href="https://x.com/" title="Twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.gazzetta.it/" title="Gazzetta Dello Sport" target="_blank">Gazzetta Dello Sport</a> refreshes, which resulted in a rather frantic day of news as we waited to find out what this meant for our plans.

Firstly, it was <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/pope-francis-funeral-serie-a-matches-postponed-italian-government-announces-five-day-period-mourning/bltd033092e7e06390f" title="Pope Francis funeral: Serie A matches postponed" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that no sport would take place on the Saturday, before a number of journalists <i>seemingly</i> confirmed that Inter v Roma would still take place on the Saturday due to their upcoming Champions League tie, but in the 20:45 kick-off slot instead. About 5 minutes later this turned out to be false, and it was confirmed that the game was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/inter-milan-vs-roma-serie-182500004.html" title="*UPDATE* Inter Milan Vs Roma Serie A Clash To Be Played Sunday: Day After Funeral Of Pope Francis" target="_blank">moved to the Sunday 15:00 kick-off</a>. This was disappointing, but at least meant we could still visit San Siro, which was the main aim of the trip and had been in doubt for 48 hours.

We then had to have a quick rejig of plans, knowing full well that we could sadly no longer attend the Juventus game anymore and would have to settle for just one. Cancellations of trains and <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/" title="AirBnB" target="_blank">AirBnBs</a> were confirmed, Juventus tickets were put on a resale site, along with us needing to make a new <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/" title="AirBnB" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> booking in Milan as we frantically tried to deal with the fallout.

<figure><img src="/images/blog/calcio-in-italia2.png" alt="A 'cultural' visit to Milan's aptly named The Football Pub, a short walk from the Duomo" width="100%">  <figcaption align="center"><i>A 'cultural' visit to Milan's aptly named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefootballpubmi/?hl=en" title="The Football Pub" target="_blank">The Football Pub</a>, a short walk from the Duomo</i></figcaption></figure> 

The day before we were due to travel out, in a piece of news we didn’t quite realise the consequences of, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/atalanta-lecce-postponed-b6090c7ad05cca57da4a7d79831ba4c0" title="Lecce’s Serie A match at Atalanta postponed following death of physio" target="_blank">Atalanta v Lecce on the Friday was postponed</a> due to the tragic passing of Lecce physio Graziano Fiorita. It was later announced that it was moved to Sunday at 20:45.

We flew out to Milan on the Saturday and enjoyed an unexpected day of being a tourist, mixed with regularly refreshing the Atalanta ticketing portal before eventually managing to get two tickets to that game.

<h6><i>Inter v Roma - San Siro</i></h6>
The Sunday began with the immensely exciting pilgrimage to San Siro to watch the league leaders (at the time) Inter take on the league’s most in-form team in Roma. As it was a nice day and there was no rush, we decided to take the metro to Lotto followed by a 15-minute walk rather than change at Lotto and take another Metro on to the dedicated San Siro station. Once at Lotto on a matchday, you do not need to worry about finding directions as the place is swarmed with people in Inter shirts on their way to the game.

San Siro itself is absolutely huge and wildly impressive. There are lots of food and drink stalls, along with plenty of merchandise stands too. You then need to go through the ID security check, followed by the standard ticket check. We had tickets in the top tier of the ground and saw the daunting spiralling walkway up - be prepared if sat high up, you’ll need to give yourself plenty of time to get up there, and down again afterwards!

In terms of the ground inside, it’s genuinely hard to describe just how impressive it is, both in terms of size and atmosphere. There are lots of facilities and things move at quite a quick pace so you’re easily able to grab a bite, coffee or beer quite quickly before the game or during half-time. Roma were the better team on the day and deservedly walked away with a <a href="https://www.beinsports.com/en-asia/football/serie-a/articles/inter-0-1-roma-serie-a-leaders-stumble-in-race-for-the-scudetto-2025-04-27" title="Inter 0-1 Roma: Serie A leaders stumble in race for the Scudetto" target="_blank">1-0 win</a> to boost their European hopes and effectively ruin Inter’s Serie A chances. A highlight was definitely the atmosphere generated by the Inter ultras who didn’t stop singing throughout, even ramping up the noise at full-time despite the defeat.

<h6><i>Atalanta v Lecce - Gewiss Stadium</h6></i>
We walked back to Lotto after the game and took the Metro to Centrale in order to catch our train to Bergamo, even having time to grab a late lunch in between. Once in Bergamo, you have a number of options for getting to the ground, but we opted for the relatively straightforward 30-minute walk through the town to the ground.

The Gewiss Stadium is very impressive from the outside, and even more impressive inside, particularly when you consider what it <a href="https://stadiumdb.com/designs/ita/stadio_atletti_azzurri_ditalia" title="Gewiss Stadium Stadium DB" target="_blank">looked like a few years ago</a> but also due to the fact that a lot of the original walls and features of the stadium remain in place. However, on arrival it was curiously quiet. Again, we had our ID checked before going in, and noticed on a wall a flyer effectively saying that the Atalanta ultras were <a href="https://football-italia.net/atalanta-ultras-back-lecce-strike-game-played/" title="Atalanta ultras back Lecce and announce strike if Serie A game played" target="_blank">going on “strike”</a> in response to the game being moved back by just two days when both teams felt it should not go ahead so soon after a tragic event.

<figure><img src="/images/blog/calcio-in-italia5.png" alt="Atalanta supporters show their displeasure at Serie A for insisting on their game with Lecce is played" width="100%">  <figcaption align="center"><i>Atalanta supporters show their displeasure at Serie A for insisting on their game with Lecce is played</i></figcaption></figure> 

There was an understandably sombre atmosphere around kick-off, with the Lecce team standing together by their dugout for a minute silence, before we also realised they were wearing all white (as opposed to their usual red and yellow) without any logos or sponsors, simply a black ribbon and the words Nessun valore, nessun colore (no values, no colours) for what they referred to in a <a href="https://football-italia.net/lecce-wear-blank-shirt-protest-trampled-values/" title="Lecce wear blank shirts in protest at ‘trampled values’ after death of physio" target="_blank">statement as a “match of trampled values”</a>.

The match kicked-off and was played in complete silence, genuinely one of the strangest atmospheres I’ve ever seen at a football match, before the Atalanta supporters burst into life right on the 15 minute mark by throwing multiple flares onto the pitch, unfurling banners protesting <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" title="Serie A" target="_blank">Serie A</a>, along with loudly whistling and chanting against the league, something that continued throughout the 90 minutes. The game itself was understandably rather tame in nature, with a goal in each half, both penalties, <a href="https://www.rai.it/dl/raiSport/speciali/statistiche/serie_a/2025/live_frame.html?id=251316_3279" title="Atalanta 1-1 Lecce" target="_blank">resulting in a 1-1 draw</a> which was followed by a standing ovation from the entire ground for the Lecce players and staff.

From there, we were able to quickly get back to Bergamo station to get the last train back to Milan. Two cities, two great stadiums, 32,000 steps and one great day of football. I am already looking forward to the next trip.
