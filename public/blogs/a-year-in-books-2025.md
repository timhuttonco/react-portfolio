### A Year In Books - 2025
Another year has passed, and with it comes the opportunity to share my usual review of books. Having broken my record for writing this at the earliest point of the year last year, I have gone full circle and written it later than ever this year. This was also the year I joined <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188309776-tim-hutton" target="_blank" title="Goodreads - Tim Hutton">Goodreads</a> for the first time and found a lot of book recommendations there. I hope you enjoy the list, and as always, I am incredibly eager to hear any reading recommendations that you may have.

<h4><i>Best Non-Fiction</h4></i>
<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75531803-killing-thatcher" target="_blank" title="Killing Thatcher - Rory Carroll">Killing Thatcher - Rory Carroll</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 10/10</h6> <p>Genuinely one of the best books I have ever read. I’m too young perhaps to have a balanced view on Margaret Thatcher so this rating is not to do with the title itself. Carroll does an incredible job of telling the story of the Brighton Bombing of 1984, when the IRA came close to assassinating the British Prime Minister and wiping out the entirety of the cabinet. What it also does brilliantly is give a succinct yet rigorous history lesson on the Northern Ireland (or North of Ireland, depending on your side) Troubles that led up to the bombing, along with the hunt for those involved. A both thrilling and highly informative read, and without doubt, my favourite of the year.</p>

<h4><i>Best Novels</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56587382-the-island-of-missing-trees" target="_blank" title="The Island of Missing Trees - Elif Shafak">The Island of Missing Trees - Elif Shafak</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 9.5/10</h6> <p>A beautiful, beautiful read set between present day London and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Tells the story of a Greek Cypriot and a Turkish Cypriot and their forbidden love, however, the story is predominantly told from the point of view of a fig tree located in the middle of their story, and the invasion. Sounds bonkers, but absolutely works - and you learn a lot about fig trees and Cyprus along the way. It’s a really moving read but also an amazing insight into that period of time.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/167006698-everyone-on-this-train-is-a-suspect" target="_blank" title="Everyone on This Train Is a Suspect - Benjamin Stevenson">Everyone on This Train Is a Suspect - Benjamin Stevenson</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 9/10</h6> <p>A both thrilling and hilarious novel that I did not realise was a sequel until I started it. I have slightly spoiled the previous book, but this one was so good that I still intend to read it. Told from the perspective of a writer during a crime-writers festival set onboard a train, it’s a really gripping plot which constantly has you rethinking whodunnit. Stevenson sets the tone and brilliantly mocks the form of murder mysteries right from the introduction; one example being when he mentions exactly how many times the murderer's name is mentioned, along with including a name count midway through. The sort of book one could gladly get through in a day.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316-babel" target="_blank" title="Babel - R.F. Kuang">Babel - R.F. Kuang</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 9/10</h6> <p>I really was not a big fan of Kuang’s Yellowface, despite the hype the book received. Babel, however, is an absolute masterpiece. It’s a historical fantasy novel set in 1828 where the premise is that language and translation, particularly meanings lost in translation, can be used for “magic”, in the form of silver bars and how the British Empire is using them to conquer the world. The main character is plucked from China and then faces a battle of conscience when his words are used to help Britain in China. It’s a book that keeps you guessing throughout, and you’ll also learn a lot of word origins that you probably didn’t know as you read.</p>

<h4><i>Notable Novels</h4></i>
<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49544193-midnight-at-malabar-house" target="_blank" title="Midnight at Malabar House - Vaseem Khan">Midnight at Malabar House - Vaseem Khan</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 8/10</h6> <p>A masterpiece of historical fiction. A thoroughly entertaining murder mystery set in post-colonial India, where the murder of an English diplomat sets off a political chain of events that India’s first female detective has to navigate. Fascinatingly written and full of historic learnings, up there with my favourite books of the year.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/785371.Lady_into_Fox" target="_blank" title="Lady Into Fox - David Garnett">Lady Into Fox - David Garnett</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6> <p>I stumbled upon this inside the “re-reading” column of the Saturday Review in The Saturday Times - a highly recommended source of good reading material. A few weeks later, I was also recommended this by my father-in-law. A relatively short novel from 1922 which involves a married couple where the lady suddenly turns into a fox. A funny and touching read as the two navigate this new life.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13609888-the-taliban-cricket-club" target="_blank" title="The Taliban Cricket Club - Timeri N. Murari">The Taliban Cricket Club - Timeri N. Murari</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6> <p>A book that I feel incredibly fortunate to have stumbled upon in a charity shop, The Taliban Cricket Club tells the story of Rukhsana, a spirited female journalist in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. When it is announced that a cricket tournament will be held with the winning team travelling to Pakistan for training - many see this as their means to escape the country. With Rukhsana being one of the only people knowing how to play cricket, a plot is formed to teach the locals and help them out. You can see where the story is going quite quickly, but it’s still a brilliant read.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233214587-if-russia-wins" target="_blank" title="If Russia Wins - Carlo Masala">If Russia Wins - Carlo Masala</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 8/10</h6> <p>Described as “a scenario”, it’s a short and sobering read where Masala discusses/predicts in novel form what will happen if the Russian invasion of Ukraine is not halted. Set in 2028 with Russia invading Estonia, If Russia Wins looks at the fragility of NATO and Europe’s current military deficiency. The scary part is that a lot of the predictions/events of the book are believable.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6383128-a-dog-day-or-the-angel-in-the-house" target="_blank" title="A Dog Day - Walter Emanuel, Cecil Aldin">A Dog Day - Walter Emanuel, Cecil Aldin</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 8/10</h6> <p>A hilarious and glorious short story following a day in the life of a mischievous dog. I would thoroughly recommend it to any dog lover.</p>

<h4><i>Notable Non-Fiction</h4></i>
<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25362017-the-girl-with-seven-names" target="_blank" title="The Girl with Seven Names: A North Korean Defector's Story - Hyeonseo Lee">The Girl with Seven Names: A North Korean Defector's Story - Hyeonseo Lee</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 8.5/10</h6> <p>The title of this one is a bit of a giveaway for what this is about. Given the secrecy of North Korea, it’s an extraordinary insight into the everyday lives of people in the country. Lee’s memoir covers her childhood years and what growing up in North Korea was like before talking about how she managed to escape from the country and eventually bring some of her family with her. Some of the insight genuinely feels hard to believe - a truly, truly fascinating life and read.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125084292-a-city-on-mars" target="_blank" title="A City on Mars - Kelly Weinersmith, Zach Weinersmith">A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through? - Kelly Weinersmith, Zach Weinersmith</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6> <p>I really enjoy a science read that manages to also be humorous. The husband and wife duo manage to do a fantastic job of achieving just that in this brilliant book. A City on Mars tries to answer all of the questions about whether it’s possible to colonise Mars, but more importantly, what would it actually look like. The mix of expertise and humour makes this a fab read.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218165580-croydonopolis" target="_blank" title="Croydonopolis - Will Noble">Croydonopolis: A Journey to the Greatest City That Never Was - Will Noble</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6> <p>A book that I only think one would find enjoyable if they had an affinity with Croydon, which is probably rare unless you have lived there, and even then, it’s still quite rare. Alas, a really interesting read for me having been raised there. Lots of historical nuggets that I had no idea about. </p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57562239-a-bump-in-the-road" target="_blank" title="A Bump in the Road - Elle Wright">A Bump in the Road: A Story of Fertility, Hope and Trying Again - Elle Wright</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 8/10</h6> <p>Wright’s previous book, Ask Me His Name, was both a beautiful and heartbreaking story of baby loss and one that certainly helped us through our own. Her follow up is another moving read as she documents her journey of trying again for a rainbow baby. Despite it being such a tough story, Wright brilliantly adds humour and humility throughout - a powerful read.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41044920-russia-without-putin" target="_blank" title="Russia Without Putin: Money, Power and the Myths of the New Cold War - Tony Wood">Russia Without Putin: Money, Power and the Myths of the New Cold War - Tony Wood</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6> <p>I’m a bit out of date by reading this as I believe it was originally published in 2018, but whilst the world has shifted and some of the events are out-dated, the underlying message certainly remains the same. Wood essentially makes the case that the Western view of Russia being all about Putin is completely incorrect, and that when the time comes for him to depart, things will not change. </p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81763.The_Prince_of_the_Marshes" target="_blank" title="The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq - Rory Stewart">The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq - Rory Stewart</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 8/10</h6> <p>I have always been a big fan of Stewart’s writing and adored reading The Places In Between, which covered his time walking across Afghanistan. This memoir talks about the time he worked as a governor in Iraq shortly after the toppling of Saddam Hussein and is an incredible account of that period. It’s set in the remote provinces of Amarah and Nasiriyah, truly a world away from present day London, with Stewart having to negotiate with British and American officials in Baghdad who have no idea what’s going on in the provinces. It’s an incredible account, culminating in the terrifying final chapters documenting when their compound was invaded.</p>

<h4><i>Other Novels</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48822080-the-englishman" target="_blank" title="The Englishman - David Gilman">The Englishman - David Gilman</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 7/10</h6> <p>I love a good spy novel and this one is pretty good. Slightly over the top in its storyline but is gripping enough with action on every page.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36101978-the-red-haired-woman" target="_blank" title="The Red-Haired Woman - Orhan Pamuk">The Red-Haired Woman - Orhan Pamuk</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6/10</h6> <p>I absolutely adored The Museum of Innocence, and this has similarly beautiful writing. It’s a bit of a retelling of Oedipus in some way and spans 30 years across the main character's life. Covers love, father-and-son relationships and paints another beautiful picture of Istanbul. </p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16375.Jeeves_and_the_Feudal_Spirit" target="_blank" title="Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit - P.G. Wodehouse">Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit - P.G. Wodehouse</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6/10</h6> <p>I found a Jeeves and Wooster Omnibus in a charity shop and am very glad I did so. As expected with Wodehouse, it’s hilarious. A very similar storyline to the previous Jeeves that I had read, Joy In The Morning, but that doesn’t stop me looking forward to reading the rest of the Omnibus.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200776812-butter" target="_blank" title="Butter - Asako Yuzuki">Butter - Asako Yuzuki</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 5/10</h6> <p>I’m really not sure I understood the hype of this book. It’s an incredibly slow story. The message of the book is focussing on Japan’s relationship with women and their role towards men, along with society’s view on weight, but as a story it doesn’t do much. It’s almost more of a recipe book with a storyline intertwined. A word of warning though, it will make you pretty hungry, but might also inspire a meal or two.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38750904-the-accidental-further-adventures-of-the-hundred-year-old-man" target="_blank" title="The Accidental Further Adventures of the Hundred-Year-Old Man - Jonas Jonasson">The Accidental Further Adventures of the Hundred-Year-Old Man - Jonas Jonasson</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6> <p>I remember seeing this and questioning why there had been a follow up to the brilliant, brilliant original. Thankfully, Jonasson answers that question in the foreword with a very interesting explanation. Once again, the writing is brilliant, humorous and it’s another wonderfully ludicrous storyline.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124028498-murder-at-holly-house" target="_blank" title="Murder at Holly House - Denzil Meyrick">Murder at Holly House - Denzil Meyrick</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 4/10</h6> <p>I read this around Christmas time as it was marketed as a Christmas read, but it just happens to take place in December, that’s essentially the only relation. It’s a decent murder mystery but it is hard to ever actually like the rather tepid main character.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30408033-a-horse-walks-into-a-bar" target="_blank" title="A Horse Walks Into A Bar - David Grossman">A Horse Walks Into A Bar - David Grossman</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 3.5/10</h6> <p>An interesting concept - almost the entire story takes place in an Israeli comedy club through the main character’s set, where he fires out some great jokes, but mostly tells the story of his life, getting more somber as it goes on. It doesn’t quite work. Even as a short story, you’re wanting to figure out how it ends very early on, and not in a good way.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56969543-bullet-train" target="_blank" title="Bullet Train - Kōtarō Isaka">Bullet Train - Kōtarō Isaka</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6/10</h6> <p>My rating for this dark thriller changed throughout. Some bits are really exciting, others drag on. It tells the story of five apparently unrelated assassins all taking the same train ride from Tokyo to Morioka, whose tales gradually merge into one in a pretty thrilling ending which brought the rating up somewhat.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123136728-orbital" target="_blank" title="Orbital - Samantha Harvey">Orbital - Samantha Harvey</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 5.5/10</h6> <p>I wanted to love this, and in some ways I do. The writing of it is truly, truly beautiful, but even as a short story, it’s hard for it to keep your attention for long. I can see why it won a Booker Prize as it’s exactly that kind of read, but don’t expect to get much excitement from it.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50150786-hitler-s-secret" target="_blank" title="Hitler’s Secret - Rory Clements">Hitler’s Secret - Rory Clements</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 4/10</h6> <p>I hadn’t read any of the other Tom Wilde series before reading this (it’s the fourth in the series) but that didn’t seem a problem. I can only really describe this as “fine”, the story is based on a suspicion that Hitler had a daughter who was sent away and it’s a British professor/agent’s job to bring her back to the United Kingdom. Quite a slow burner without that much dramatic action.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36217425-th1rt3en" target="_blank" title="Th1rt3en - Steve Cavanagh">Th1rt3en - Steve Cavanagh</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 3.5/10</h6> <p>The tagline for this is “The serial killer isn’t on trial. He’s on the jury”. This was enough to rope me in as it seemed like it could be a fascinating storyline. However, this actually ends up being a bit of a detriment to the book; knowing that the character is going to end up on the jury takes away quite a lot of the suspense from the first half of the read. It swings between the story of the two main characters which does make it interesting, but the storyline does become quite unbelievable pretty quickly.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211603176-death-in-the-arctic" target="_blank" title="Death In The Arctic - Tom Hindle">Death In The Arctic - Tom Hindle</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 4.5/10</h6> <p>The third book by Hindle that I’ve read, and sadly the most disappointing. Feels like he’s found a formula and success with the first book and therefore perhaps been pushed to churn out follow ups quickly. Takes place on an arctic blimp and just never really gets dramatic enough to hold attention. </p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220508729-the-malt-whisky-murders" target="_blank" title="The Malt Whisky Murders - Natalie Jayne Clark">The Malt Whisky Murders - Natalie Jayne Clark</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 3.5/10</h6> <p>I actually picked this book up in our local library, something I haven’t done in years, ahead of a weekend away without really reading too much into it. The basis of the story is a couple purchase a distillery and find two dead bodies in old barrels. It’s quite a slog to get through and aspects of the writing feels very forced.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43256597-night-boat-to-tangier" target="_blank" title="Night Boat to Tangier - Kevin Barry">Night Boat to Tangier - Kevin Barry</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 1.5/10</h6> <p>Safe to say from my rating that I did not enjoy this much. The story revolves around two old drug dealers waiting in a port for one of their daughters who they have not seen for years. The book then goes back through them talking about their memories and to what brought them there, but I didn’t buy into it, or the characters, at all.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead" target="_blank" title="Demon Copperhead - Barbara Kingsolver">Demon Copperhead - Barbara Kingsolver</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 2/10</h6> <p>I saw a lot of hype for this book and held off on starting it for a while. It’s not only a very long read but for me wasn’t a very enjoyable one either. It feels immensely soulless at times and I find the writing just a bit dull, and also immensely predictable.</p>

<h4><i>Other Non-Fiction</h4></i>
<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35377232-berlin-1936" target="_blank" title="Berlin 1936 - Oliver Hilmes">Berlin 1936 - Oliver Hilmes</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6> <p>I found this short read super interesting on the Berlin Olympics of 1936. Whilst taking you through the events at the Games, it also tells the story of many of the characters of Berlin, including diplomats, journalists and bar owners. A great insight.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61358638-poverty-by-america" target="_blank" title="Poverty, By America - Matthew Desmond">Poverty, By America - Matthew Desmond</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6/10</h6> <p>I’ve also got Desmond’s Evicted on my Kindle ready to go and definitely intend on reading it soon. In Poverty…, Desmond makes the argument that poverty exists because the rest of us benefit from it. It’s a fascinating take, and also a worrying look into the world of poverty.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1032.Trump" target="_blank" title="Trump: The Art of the Deal - Donald J. Trump">Trump: The Art of the Deal - Donald J. Trump</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 3/10</h6> <p>An important note to start on this one - reading does not mean condoning or supporting! It’s been on my Kindle for a long time, purely out of curiosity. It’s not a particularly exciting read, and does give you an insight into his head, even all those years ago. Many a page will cause an eyeroll, however.</p>

<h5><h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38748985-domina" target="_blank" title="Domina: The Women Who Made Imperial Rome - Guy de la Bédoyère">Domina: The Women Who Made Imperial Rome - Guy de la Bédoyère</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6/10</h6> <p>Enjoyed reading this take on how the bloodline of the Roman Empire was able to continue thanks to the women of the era and the power they wielded.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51003632-left-out" target="_blank" title="Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour Under Corbyn - Gabriel Pogrund, Patrick Maguire">Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour Under Corbyn - Gabriel Pogrund, Patrick Maguire</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 5/10</h6> <p>Insider scoop on Corbyn’s time as Labour leader. I remember being swept up a bit in it all at the time, however, I was very unaware of some of the events referenced in the book. Does really open your eyes to how chaotic the Labour organisation was at that time, and arguably continues to be.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60320723-a-waiter-in-paris" target="_blank" title="A Waiter In Paris - Edward Chisholm">A Waiter In Paris - Edward Chisholm</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 5.5/10</h6> <p>Now, this is actually a really interesting read about working as a waiter in Paris and seeing the side of the city you will definitely not be aware of, both in terms of how the restaurants work there, but also the homes and lives of those working on not a lot of money. However, what actually brings the score down is the author himself, a very difficult character to like.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8099187-decision-points" target="_blank" title="Decision Points - George W. Bush">Decision Points - George W. Bush</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 4/10</h6> <p>I enjoy a political memoir, and some chapters in this were really interesting, others were incredibly dull. Does give an insight into the life of a President, and the concept is to make it based on decisions rather than a time based memoir. I like the concept, but it doesn’t quite land in some chapters.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188543465-the-trading-game" target="_blank" title="The Trading Game - Gary Stevenson">The Trading Game - Gary Stevenson</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 6/10</h6> <p>The story of how a man from a working class background made it to the trading floor. A slightly terrifying read and insight into the world of finance. I’m still on the fence about how I feel about Stevenson. A well told story, and easy to get through quickly.</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28862.The_Prince" target="_blank" title="The Prince - Niccolò Machiavelli">The Prince - Niccolò Machiavelli</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 4/10</h6> <p>Just not for me. Rather foolishly, I thought it would be a work of fiction so I was very surprised by the first chapter. From there, it was a drag to get through this and I didn’t enjoy it. Takes you through the rules of being a prince - all a bit odd in my view.
</p>

<h5><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked" target="_blank" title="The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness - Ichiro Kishimi, Fumitake Koga">The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness - Ichiro Kishimi, Fumitake Koga</a></h5> <h6>Rating: 3/10</h6> <p>The only thing I got from this was the courage to dislike this book. All quite basic psychology and very repetitive, also incredibly condescending.</p>
