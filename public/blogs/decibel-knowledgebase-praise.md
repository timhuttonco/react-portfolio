### Decibel Knowledge Base Praise

I'm very late to the party regarding this. By late, I mean I have only seen the article in question a year after it was posted! However, Hubspot have listed the <a href="https://www.timothyhutton.net/p/decibel-insight-knowledgebase" title="Decibel Insight Knowledgebase" target="_blank">Decibel knowledge base</a> that I built in their list of excellent knowledge base examples, in good company with Microsoft and Optimizely.

<a href="https://www.hubspot.com" title="Hubspot" target="_blank">Hubspot</a>, developer and marketer of inbound marketing and sales software, created an excellent, in-depth article around Knowledge Base creation.

Titled <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/knowledge-base" title="Creating and Managing a Knowledge Base: The Ultimate Guide" target="_blank">Creating &amp; Managing a Knowledge Base: The Ultimate Guide</a>, Alex Birkett's guide takes you through why a knowledge base is important, factors to think about when creating a knowledge base, software that you can use, along with good examples of live knowledge bases.

It is these examples which drew my attention, as at number 5, none other than the <a href="https://www.timothyhutton.net/p/decibel-insight-knowledgebase" title="Decibel Insight Knowledgebase" target="_blank">Decibel knowledge base</a> that I created is listed, alongside other excellent examples from the likes of Microsoft, Optimizely, Survey Monkey and Moz.

Praised for it's strong searchability factor and the fact that you can raise support tickets directly from any page within the knowledge base, Birkett says that "everything is clear, intuitive, and lacks clutter and complexity".

The article continues: "Looking at the actual knowledge base articles, you'll see Decibel Insight often uses a combination of thorough text instructions and visual video-based education. This maximizes for both dinstinct learning style and the SEO benefits of thorough how-to text".

It is always exciting to see work praised, particularly something that takes a lot of time and effort, but even more so when that work is put in the same bracket as some very respectable and successful industry leaders.
