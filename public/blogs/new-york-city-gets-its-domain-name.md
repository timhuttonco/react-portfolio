### New York City Gets Its Own Domain Name

New York City has become the first city in the world to be awarded with its very own top level domain name this month, in a move that is hoped will help local businesses and organisations become more identifiable.

Net address regulator <a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" title="ICANN">ICANN</a> has approved .nyc as the official top level domain for New York City, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stating that the move <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=A08875E3-C29C-7CA2-F8E280AAD98676BB" target="_blank">“puts New York City at the forefront of the digital landscape.”</a>

Applications for the new .nyc domain name will open in late 2013, and for applicants to register, they are required to have a physical address in New York City.

> Christine C. Quinn, who is hoping to succeed Mr Bloomberg as Mayor, has pushed for the creation of domain since 2009, and said: “With a new top-level domain name, New York won’t just be the greatest city in the world — we’ll also be the greatest city on the internet.”

The City had applied to ICANN for administrative and management control over the .nyc domain in March of last year, paying a $185,000 application fee. ICANN approved the application in May of this year.

As of July 8th, over 31,000 applications had been made for the new domain through the website <a href="https://www.uniteddomains.com/new-top-level-domain/nyc-domain-registration/" target="_blank" title="United Domains">uniteddomains.com</a>, while <a href="http://www.mydotnyc.com/" target="_blank">mydotnyc.com</a> has been set up to help interested parties with the application process.

ICANN, meanwhile, has already evaluated a number of other cities who are interested in having their own domain name, with London and Paris both passing initial evaluations.
