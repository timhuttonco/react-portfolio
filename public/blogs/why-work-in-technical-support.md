### Why Work In Technical Support?

*The below was written as part of a wider project with some former colleagues that may see the light of day eventually. For now, I have published a few of the articles here.*

#### A foot in the door and a great starting point 

Depending on your experience and skill level, a starting role in Technical Support could be the perfect first step in your technical career. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-smith-b435127b" target="_blank" title="Stuart Smith">Stuart Smith</a>, now Full Stack Developer at Stereo says: “My first job was as a Support Developer and it is a great way to get your foot in the door. The role gave me the opportunity to explore different areas in the industry whether it was Dev Ops, front-end or backend. I wanted to become a backend engineer, so I used the skills I was learning at work and spent a lot of time at home studying to achieve my next goal.” Because of the vast array of items you will cover in a Technical Support role, it is a great way to find your feet while gradually learning and excelling in the areas that interest you for when you are ready to make the next step. 

#### It is a career in itself 

That being said, the role itself will constantly develop, with many finding that they enjoy the fast-paced nature and challenges that come with a Technical Support role. While it can be a foot in the door, it can also be a career in itself. There are plenty of promotion opportunities within the Technical Support area without having to move to engineering or other areas. Many enjoy the day-to-day of the role and end up staying in Technical Support for large parts of their career. 

#### You will develop your soft skills immensely 

Soft skills play a very important part in becoming great in the role. You will find yourself using your soft skills every day, ensuring that it is not just your technical knowledge that is improving with every case that you may come up against. You will find yourself improving your writing and speaking skills, learning how to deal with multiple teams across a business and often how to improve your telephone/video call manner. These will all stand you in good stead for whichever way you want to develop in your career. 

#### Every day will be a learning day 

This really is one of the biggest pros of working in Technical Support. Even in a first-line role, which some may just associate with leaving holding comments and passing on to others, it is rarely the case. You will deal with a complex array of different cases on a daily basis, where no two days will be the same. It makes for a fun, fast-paced, ever-evolving role which you will grow to enjoy and find yourself learning something new all the time. You will learn from doing things yourself, but also from other members of the team too when knowledge is shared. 

#### You will work hands-on with a product and accelerate learning 

Working in Tech Support, you will be expected to become a product expert because you need to be able to support the product and share that knowledge with clients as and when they need it. This means you will constantly be learning new things about the product and the technical details behind it, meaning that you will simply be learning just by doing your job! On top of this, in the right team and company, you will also benefit from additional training or resources. Lots of companies will have training budgets for their employees meaning you will be learning through your everyday role along with having the opportunity to learn things on top of that. 

#### There are so many directions that you can go in 

Because you are dabbling in so many different parts of a product and the things that put it together, it means you will get a real 360-degree view of a business, which in turn can then help you decide which direction you want to take your career in. It could be into an implementation role, an engineering role, data science, or even in the direction of customer success, sales or technical consulting if you really enjoy the client-side of things. <a href="https://www.builtinaustin.com/2017/03/23/tech-support-jobs-lead-promotions" target="_blank" title="Why Getting a Job in Tech Support Puts You on the Fast Track to a Promotion">Built in Austin</a> has some fantastic success stories of people who have started in Technical Support roles and gone on to work in different roles.
