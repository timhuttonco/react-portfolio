### Seven Signs You Should Look for a New Job

###### By Artur Meyster of Career Karma

When people feel uncomfortable at work, they start to wonder if it's time to look for a new job. In 2021, the competition has become tougher, and there are a few things every worker expects from employers. Having a good salary is not enough. If you're looking to have better job opportunities in the future, you should demand what you need.

Many employees ignore huge warning signs because they are scared of losing their job. But, let me tell you that you don't have to be afraid of change. Due to the pandemic, the rules of the game have changed. To remain competitive, you need to adapt. To help you do just that, here are some signs that you should start looking for a new job.

#### You Can't Be Yourself

If your current position is taking away your personality, this is a big sign you should look for a new job. Your personality is what makes you unique. That's the reason why artists and designers can create outstanding products. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to do their job. If you can't be yourself at work, find ways to fix the problem.

The problem could be that your daily tasks don't match your expectations, and you feel like a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/07/06/the-biggest-robot-companies-and-their-most-scary-inventions/#6d6df9d022bf" target="_blank" title="The Biggest Robot Companies And Their Most Scary Inventions">robot</a>, emotionless. If this is the case, ask your boss if there's something else you can do. Try to collaborate on a project that makes you feel inspired. If what you are doing now makes you feel like someone else and you are unmotivated, you'd better start looking for a new job.

#### You Feel Professionally Stuck 

Feeling stuck should be in the top 5 <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/reasons-for-leaving-a-job/" target="_blank" title="How to Discuss Your Reasons for Leaving a Job: A Guide">reasons for leaving a job</a>. Having professional development is what will provide you with better job opportunities. If you can't develop your skills, you'll be left behind. In 2021, employers' requirements are higher. If you can't meet their expectations, how are you supposed to get a job? If your company doesn't help you improve your skills, this is a sign that should not be ignored.

Many companies are making attractive offers to attract skilled candidates. Because tech skills are vital, they are providing great tuition perks to professionals in this sector. For example, companies like Nintendo, Samsung, and Amazon provide their workers with tuition reimbursement benefits. As they can enroll in any program and get their money back, staying relevant is not a struggle. So, to move forward, don't hesitate to write a resignation letter if necessary.

#### You Can't Use Your Strengths

You should know your strengths and if you will be able to use them before applying for a job. Not using your strengths at your workplace can leave you frustrated. Imagine a software engineer making hamburgers or a cybersecurity specialist running a bakery. Those indeed are great jobs but don’t allow these professionals to use their <a href="https://bootcamprankings.com/what-is-coding-used-for/" target="_blank" title="What is Coding Used For? A Programming Primer">coding skills</a>. If you can't use your best skills in your current position, it is a pretty big sign you should quit.

When workers don't use their best skills, they can become obsolete and won't perform well. On the other hand, when employees feel comfortable and able to employ their skills, they lead companies to success. If you're looking to have a better life, you need a job that makes you feel comfortable. Don't be afraid to quit if your current job is not your right match.   

#### Your Responsibilities Make You Feel Constantly Stressed

Overwork leads to frustration. When employees feel overwhelmed and stressed, they have an awful performance. If you have to deal with stressful situations very often, you should analyze the situation. Not being able to handle your responsibilities can be hard on your pride. But, never stop asking for help if you need it.

If you feel you're always stressed and overwhelmed, ask your boss for a break. It can help you to clear your mind and start over. However, if it happens frequently, looking for a new job would be the right decision.

#### The Company Doesn't Allow You to Grow

Growing is a natural process in life. When employees don't have growth opportunities, they feel frustrated and unmotivated. After all, being in the same place for years is not healthy. If you think your work life is monotonous, try to find a solution. Ask your boss if you can get a promotion; it would be a great way to solve the issue. If the company fails to provide you with growth opportunities, know that you're probably wasting your time in your current position.

#### The Work Environment Is Awful

Imagine being in a place where people are in a bad mood day and night. No matter how excited you are in the beginning, after a few hours, you'll lose motivation. If you spend too many hours with people complaining, you'll start to complain too. But, if you spend several hours with optimistic people, you'll become more optimistic yourself.

If the work environment at your current position is awful, you have a good reason to look for a new job. When employees are in a bad mood, they can't focus, and their performance is poor. For that reason, try to spend time with people who like to find solutions instead of problems. They will provide you with great energy and vibes to have a better life.

#### There Is No Teamwork

Most jobs require teamwork. In fact, a company would be nothing without collaboration. If the company you work for doesn't promote teamwork, you should undoubtedly quit. Working in teams allows you to improve your soft skills as well as learn new things. Also, it makes you feel motivated because someone has your back.

When employees feel part of a big family, they work harder to meet employers' demands. If you don't receive support at work, sooner or later, you'll lose motivation. Try to find a job in which you stay motivated. This will improve your work-life balance and will help you to achieve happiness. Keep in mind that we spend almost all our time working. 

#### In Summary

Don't be afraid to look for a new job if your current position provides you with nothing more than a salary. Since people spend about 45 hours per week at work, having a work-life balance is essential. Also, look for vacancies that can help you improve your skills. The competition is getting fiercer, and you wouldn't like to be left behind. Considering these signs will help you to make the right move.
