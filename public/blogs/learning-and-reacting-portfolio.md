### Learning and Reacting: Migrating a portfolio to React

2020 was a strange year, we can all agree. I found myself with a lot of extra time throughout this, particularly due to the fact that the majority of the U.K. were <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020" title="GovUk Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 March 2020" target="_blank">confined to their homes</a> for many months of the year. Like many, I aimed to make use of the extra time gained from no longer commuting, socialising or well, doing anything really - *I would love to claim I got my once-a-day permitted exercise during lockdown but the closest I probably came to increasing my heart rate was from playing <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/" title="Football Manager" target="_blank">Football Manager</a>* - by setting ambitious goals of completing projects, courses and learning new skills. But, like most that I have spoken to, that was a lot easier said than done and a lot of those tasks remain in the To Do list on <a href="https://trello.com/" title="Trello" target="_blank">Trello</a>, or in my purchased list on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" title="Udemy" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, potentially never to be viewed.

One of the items on the list that I did manage to achieve, however, was deciding to make it the year that I finally tackled <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="ReactJS" target="_blank">React</a> in a bit more detail, with the eventual aim of also updating my portfolio site to run on React. After all, my site hasn't changed in look or feel for nearly 6 years so it was probably time for a change. The eagle-eyed among you may notice that I have also finally migrated the domain - because, well, I don't exactly go by the name Timothy often but it was the best thing available all those years ago! There are still plenty of improvements and updates to be made to the site, but for now it feels like it's at an acceptable and shareable status.

Throughout working on this, I compiled a list of bookmarks that I found useful as part of the learning and building that I thought it would be beneficial to share with anyone else looking to work on something similar. Some of the links are to free or paid courses and tutorials that can hopefully help improve knowledge, while others link to relevant libraries that I have either used on this site, or explored in some detail as part of research that may be useful to others.

###### Learning The Basics
In terms of learning, I started with my usual approach of using <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" title="Codecademy" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> - which has not <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101" title="Codecademy Learn React" target="_blank">one</a>, but <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-102" title="Codecademy Learn React" target="_blank">two parts</a> to their <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101" title="Codecademy Learn React" target="_blank">React course</a> available for free *(sign in required)* - to go over the basics and review uses. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/" title="freeCodeCamp" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> meanwhile, have produced a fantastic <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-beginner-handbook/" title="React for Beginners – A React.js Handbook for Front End Developers" target="_blank">React.js Handbook for Front End Developers</a> which I would highly recommend taking the time to read and follow along. It is also available to <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/page/react-handbook/" title="React for Beginners – A React.js Handbook for Front End Developers" target="_blank">download for free</a> in PDF, ePub or Mobi format. Depending on your preferred method of learning, it might be beneficial to start with this before diving in.

Additionally, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" title="Pluralsight" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> has a useful <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-js-getting-started" title="React: Getting Started" target="_blank">Getting Started with React</a> course, although a paid subscription is required. However, they are currently offering a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/free-trial" title="TRY PLURALSIGHT SKILLS FOR FREE" target="_blank">free trial</a>, covering not just React but most languages and frameworks.

Personally, I am a huge fan of "producing" tutorials, which cover not only programming skills, but also help you build something with the skills that you are taught. A few that I found useful included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtOmmC3Z8WSn45VgTAKBHhA" title="Code and Create" target="_blank">Code and Create's</a> tutorial covering the creation of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqup-BL3VjI" title="React App with Context API and React Hooks / Build a Task Manager using React / Context API / Hooks" target="_blank">Task Manager using React</a>, and <a href="https://www.weibenfalk.com/" title="Thomas Weibenfalk" target="_blank">Thomas Weibenfalk's</a> course on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0" title="React / Typescript Tutorial - Build a Quiz App" target="_blank">Building a Quiz App</a>.

My personal favourite, however, and one that I would highly recommend to anyone attempting to learn React, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/codingaddict" title="Coding Addict" target="_blank">Coding Addict's</a> 6-hour <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPQ1-33teR4" title="Build an e-commerce site from scratch using React and Netlify" target="_blank">Build an e-commerce site from scratch using React and Netlify</a> tutorial *(full disclosure - I definitely did not complete this in one viewing!)*. It is a great introduction to usimg <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" title="npmjs" target="_blank">npm</a> and lots of the React basics, all while creating an example e-commerce website selling mobile phones. Bonuses of this video include humourous delievery from the course tutor, and a quick run-through at the end for hosting using a combination of <a href="https://github.com/" title="Learn Git and GitHub without any code!" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" title="Netlify" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. You can see the simple end result for yourself <a href="https://th-react-phone-store.netlify.app/" target="_blank" title="Store">here</a>.

###### Useful Libraries &amp; Features
Hopefully the above gives you some good starting points for beginning or continuing your <a href="https://reactjs.org/" title="ReactJS" target="_blank">React</a> learning. As mentioned above, I have tried to compile not just the tutorials that I used throughout, but also libraries and features that I have explored or used which may be of use to you in the future.

To begin with, <a href="https://reactrouter.com/" title="React Router" target="_blank">React Router</a> is a collection of navigational components, allowing you to utilise features such as dynamic route matching and transition handling, meaning you can easily implement navigation in your single-page application without the page refreshing, and still having changing/bookmarkable URLs throughout, such as the link for this article. Some useful guides to React Router include the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginner-s-guide-to-react-router-53094349669/" title="Beginner’s Guide to React Router" target="_blank">Beginner’s Guide to React Router</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@marcellamaki/a-brief-overview-of-react-router-and-client-side-routing-70eb420e8cde" title="A Brief Overview of React Router and Client-Side Routing" target="_blank">A Brief Overview of React Router and Client-Side Routing</a> and <a href="https://www.newline.co/@andreeamaco/how-to-handle-navigation-in-your-app-with-react-router-link--088f82d3" title="How to handle navigation in your app with React Router Link" target="_blank">How to handle navigation in your app with React Router Link</a>, while detailed documentation and code examples can be found at <a href="https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start" title="React Router Quick Start" target="_blank">reactrouter.com</a>.

If routing is less important, or you are looking to build a pure single-page website and want smooth scrolling when users click to be taken between sections, then <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll" title="react-scroll" target="_blank">react-scroll</a> is a very useful and simple-to-use library which achieves this. An example of this can be seen on the homepage of this website when you click on a button such as *Get In Touch*, which then scrolls down to the component at the bottom of the page that includes a contact form. James Quick has written a very useful guide to using react-scroll on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> entitled <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-smooth-scrolling-in-react" title="How To Implement Smooth Scrolling in React" target="_blank">How To Implement Smooth Scrolling in React</a>.

Speaking of contact forms, another item researched during the building of this was the sending of emails in React. If you don't want to create a backend purely for email purposes or are looking to avoid exposure of any server information in your code, you can use intermediary services such as <a href="https://emailjs.com" target="_blank" title="emailjs.com Send Email Directly From JavaScript">EmailJS</a> which does most of the hard work for you. <a href="https://medium.com/@kirstenmwerner" title="Medium Kirsten Werner" target="_blank">Kirsten Werner</a> has written a great article on <a href="https://medium.com/kirsten-werner/using-a-react-form-to-send-information-directly-to-your-email-2c9666f0d63a" target="_blank" title="Using a React form to send information directly to your email">how to use this service with React</a>. *Note: Any external libraries and third parties should, of course, always be researched before using.*

Meanwhile, if you are looking to use React to host content, such as a news site, blog or portfolio, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios" title="Axios" target="_blank">Axios</a> is a very useful <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" title="promise-based" target="_blank">promise-based</a> HTTP client for making simple HTTP requests and managing the responses. Some useful articles on using Axios can be found on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-axios-react" title="Digital Ocean How To Use Axios with React" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/rest-api-react-fetch-axios/" title="Smashing Magazine Consuming REST APIs In React With Fetch And Axios" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/what-is-axios-and-how-to-use-it-with-react-1470d19e1b83" title="Medium What is Axios and how to use it with React" target="_blank">Medium</a>. In addition, it is great to use in collaboration with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> for easy-to-create and display content, with <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" title="The Markdown Guide" target="_blank">markdownguide.org</a> containing great documentation, how-tos and syntax for markdown usage. 

Finally, a few more things that may come in handy for your projects include <a href="https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga" title="GitHub React-ga" target="_blank">react-ga</a> for implementing <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/analytics/" target="_blank" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> into your React app (*please be aware that this only supports <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en" target="_blank" title="Universal Analytics">Universal Analytics</a> currently and not the new <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681" target="_blank" title="Meet the next generation of Google Analytics">GA4</a> properties; for that, see <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ga-4-react" target="_blank" title="GA4React - Google Analytics 4 React">ga-4-react</a>*), <a href="https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react" title="Font Awesome React" target="_blank">Font Awesome's React Component</a> to implement icons across your app, and <a href="https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet" title="GitHub React-helmet" target="_blank">React Helmet</a> for dynamically setting meta tags to be read by search engines and social media posts.
