### Delayed From Denver

The title of this post is for two reasons: the first being the fact that I returned from Denver around a month ago, and the second being the fact that my return was delayed due to <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-weather-forecast-london-and-southeast-could-be-colder-than-north-pole-as-snow-warnings-issued-a3774826.html" target="_blank" title="UK weather forecast latest: London and the south-east could be colder than North Pole amid snow warnings after Siberian blast hits">inclement weather in London</a>.

In February, I was fortunate enough to travel to Denver for a week as part of my role as <a href="http://www.timothyhutton.net/b/decibel-insight-promotion" target="_blank" title="Promotion To Senior Solutions Engineer">Senior Solutions Engineer</a> at <a href="http://www.decibelinsight.com/" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel</a>. The U.S. half of the team that I work within, Service Delivery, is located in Denver, the capital of Colorado. I've been fortunate enough to meet all of the team members from Denver previously in our London office, and of course from talking to them most days, however only through <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" title="Slack">Slack</a>, email or <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" title="Skype">Skype</a>.

This was to be my first visit to the States, and I was duly mocked by those that lived there or had visited previously about how much I would enjoy going through security upon arrival.

By way of preparation after receiving my flight information, my first port of call was of course the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/" target="_blank" title="U.S. Customs and Border Protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> to get my <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/application.html?execution=e1s1" target="_blank" title="ESTA">ESTA</a> sorted; a fairly long but pain-free process (however, in the wake of the Facebook data privacy scandal, try not to laugh when reading the terms and conditions when you start the application), and I received confirmation that I would be allowed to enter the United States around 15 minutes after applying.

The <a href="https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/home#/" target="_blank" title="British Airways">British Airways</a> flight over, around 9 hours, was simple enough, even for someone whose longest ever flight previously was half that time, as was (rather surprisingly) the security upon arrival at <a href="https://www.flydenver.com/" target="_blank" title="Denver International Airport">Denver International Airport</a>. A few quick questions about why I was there and what I did for a living, a question I still struggle to answer in one sentence, and I was in the land of the free and the home of the brave, albeit a little startled by the <a href="https://www.flydenver.com/about/art_culture/spirit_people" target="_blank" title="Spirit of the People - Denver International Airport">Native American chants</a> that are played through the speakers of the arrival terminal.

Getting into downtown Denver where I was staying was very straightforward given my afternoon arrival. Perhaps an evening/overnight one would not have been so simple. There is a <a href="https://www.denver.org/about-denver/transportation/airport-rail/" target="_blank" title="Denver Airport Rail - Visit Denver">train service</a> (which is of course <a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/a-line.shtml" target="_blank" title="University of Colorado A Line">sponsored</a> because, well, America) to Union Station that takes just over half an hour at a cost of $9.

The apartment near Confluence Park that I stayed in was located just a 7 minute walk away from the <a href="https://www.wework.com/" target="_blank" title="WeWork">WeWork</a> office in Downtown Denver and arranged through <a href="https://www.stayalfred.com/" target="_blank" title="Stay Alfred">Stay Alfred</a>. Detailed instructions of check-in were provided which made things very straightforward, particularly for someone who had been awake for nearly 24 hours by the time I arrived. The apartment itself included a balcony, along with communal gym, swimming pool, hot tub, sun beds and outdoor grills. Perfect for the summer, but not for February when it is -12 degrees!

It was great to spend time working closely with the team there and experiencing American office culture. It was also incredibly interesting to see the flow of the day. Our U.S. office arrives at 7am Mountain Time (2pm in the UK), when the UK office has been in for around 5 hours already, and the day peaks from the moment you walk into the office.

I was previously warned that it was impossible to get a good cup of tea by a few English colleagues who have made the trip, however both the apartment and the office had <a href="https://www.bigelowtea.com/" target="_blank" title="Bigelow">Bigelow</a> "English Teatime" which I found was more than good enough.

In terms of things to do, I was accompanied most days to lunch, dinner and drinks by colleagues, and found a large array of good bars and food places throughout Downtown Denver. Particular highlights included <a href="https://www.redrobin.com/" target="_blank" title="Red Robin">Red Robin</a> (don't judge me!), which is an American burger chain that a colleague who had previously worked in the UK described as between Burger King and GBK, where you can also purchase bottomless fries. <a href="http://www.delectableegg.com/" target="_blank" title="Delectable Egg">Delectable Egg</a> was also incredibly enjoyable, along with incredibly filling; The Idaho Skillet well and truly put me into a "food coma".

The Wednesday to Wednesday trip allowed me to explore on the weekend, and I ventured through Commons Park and into Highland on the Saturday, where a number of good bars can be found including <a href="http://www.alehousedenver.com/" target="_blank" title="Ale House">Ale House</a>, <a href="http://denverbeerco.com/" target="_blank" title="Denver Beer Co.">Denver Beer Co.</a> and <a href="http://www.forestroom5.com/" target="_blank" title="Forest Room 5">Forest Room 5</a>.

Back across the South Platte River, I ticked the <a href="https://mcadenver.org/" target="_blank" title="Museum Of Contemporary Art">Museum Of Contemporary Art</a> off the to-do list, and would thoroughly recommend doing so. Entry is just $8 and there are three floors of exhibitions which change every month. Another interesting find was <a href="http://www.the-1up.com/" target="_blank" title="The 1up">The 1up</a>, an arcade bar full of classic arcade games which kept me occupied for a few hours!

I couldn't go to the States without taking in a form of sport, and the fact that every bar has a minimum of two screens showing sports only intensified this. The Sunday evening saw us head for a team outing to the <a href="http://www.pepsicenter.com/" target="_blank" title="Pepsi Center">Pepsi Center</a> to see the Denver Nuggets take on the Houston Rockets. Tickets are fairly easy to come by as it rarely sells out, and top tier seats are as little as $17. As someone who is used to British sport, I found the whole ordeal pretty hilarious, with the whole evening a ludicrous, but enjoyable, event with every break in play punctuated by cheerleaders, contests, Kiss Cams and even nacho cam, where a cameraman walks around feeding spectators nachos while filming them. Oh, America! I would recommend attending an NBA game, and they are pretty regular, while I have been warned that the NFL, another on the bucket list, can be pretty expensive.

You will find plenty of things to do in Denver, from shops to restaurants to bars, and getting around is pretty easy too, be it by bus or train, or even Uber, which felt pretty cheap and easy compared to London.

Denver itself was an impressive city, even if it was covered in snow the entire time I was there, with a lot of things to do to keep one occupied. One thing that was interesting was the fact that snow was just seen as normal there, and yet the fact it snowed in London the day of my return meant my journey back from Heathrow was chaos!

I would certainly recommend visiting the Mile High City, particularly if you are looking for something different from your traditional places to visit in America, such as New York or LA.

One regret from the trip was that I didn't get the opportunity to see <a href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/" target="_blank" title="Red Rocks Amphitheatre">Red Rocks Amphitheatre</a> or head into the mountains for some hiking, but given the weather it was probably for the best. Hopefully there will be another visit when it is a bit warmer!
