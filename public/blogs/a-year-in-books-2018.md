### A Year In Books

I often find myself struggling when trying to recommend a good read to friends or colleagues. Rather than going through the repeated umming and ahhing, I decided to collate the books that I have read and enjoyed (or not) and send them here instead.

N.B. The above photo was taken in 2017, which is why Kevin Kelly's excellent book <a href="https://amzn.to/2QCHBtz" title="The Inevitable" target="_blank">"The Inevitable"</a> is not present in the list below. All books were read by myself, with no assistance from the cat.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SKvsFp" title="Who Can You Trust?" target="_blank" id="WhoCanYouTrust"></a><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SKvsFp">Who Can You Trust?: How Technology Brought Us Together – and Why It Could Drive Us Apart - Rachel Botsman:</a> The first book of the year was Rachel Botsman's excellent take on how trust in institutions is at an all-time low, yet the age of "distributed trust" seems to be just beginning. Think about the trust involved in ordering an Uber and allowing a stranger to drive you home, or using AirBnB to let your home to, or stay in the home of, someone you have never met. Botsman's book is excellently written and easy to read, and looks at how trust has driven society in the past, how recent start ups have relied on trust, and why distributed trust is becoming more and more important. A really thought provoking read that I would recommend.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SKxZj2" title="Losing the Signal" target="_blank" id="LosingTheSignal">Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of Blackberry - Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff:</a> This was certainly one of my favourite books of the year. I read the majority of this on a flight from London to Denver and could barely put it down. During the peak of their success, I personally couldn't see Blackberry being dethroned. Mcnish and Silcoff take you through the events that helped Blackberry reach their heights, along with what caused it to all come crashing down, in what is an incredibly intriguing read. This book includes some painful moments that will leave you shaking your head and wondering what drove these terrible decisions. 

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hit-Refresh-Rediscover-Microsofts-Everyone-ebook/dp/B01HOT5SQA" title="Hit Refresh" target="_blank" id="HitRefresh">Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft's Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone - Satya Nadella:</a> I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by Nadella's book. I'm a huge fan of him and am enjoying seeing the changes that he has been making at Microsoft, however I thought this would be a lot more interesting. While Nadella's description of his career, and mistakes, make for good reading, it too often felt like a sales pitch for Microsoft, the changes that he has brought and the new products that they are building.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2u52N3B" title="Life to the Limit" target="_blank" id="LifeToTheLimit">Life to the Limit - Jenson Button:</a> Had I compiled this list in any previous years, there most certainly would not be just one sporting book in it. However, Jenson Button's autobiography is the only one that fits the category for this year. A very honest and funny insight into his life, particularly racing in junior categories, this made for an enjoyable and easy read which I would recommend to any motorsport fans.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2FeEUZR" title="The Four" target="_blank" id="" thefour="">The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google - Scott Galloway:</a> Interestingly, this book was written before both Apple and Amazon became the first companies to reach a market valuation of one trillion dollars. Galloway discusses in one of the final chapters of the book which company he thinks will be the first to do so (spoilter alert: he is wrong). Galloway doesn't exactly give the reader much in terms of "hidden DNA" regarding the companies, and the book also has an air of anger towards these four. Galloway himself admits that he has been part of companies that have been put out of business by one of the four. While it is interesting and points out flaws in some of them, Galloway has only ever worked against the companies and not for them, meaning there is hardly an "insider" part of the story.

<a href="https://amzn.to/39wkzgt" title="Bad Blood" target="_blank" id="BadBlood">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup - John Carreyrou:</a> This was definitely my favourite book of the year (perhaps because it was read in its entirety while on a beach in Italy), and reads like a thrilling novel from start to finish despite being a true story. I had been fascinated by Theranos and their CEO Elizabeth Holmes and recall the day that the first articles started being released about how all may not be as it seemed at the company. Carreyrou takes you through the rise and fall of Theranos in spectacular detail in a book that is very hard to put down once you have started.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2QhNaP7" title="Origin Story" target="_blank" id="OriginStory">Origin Story: A Big History of Everything - David Christian:</a> There are a few books on this topic (Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is the first to spring to mind, and it is on my to-read list), but I was attracted to this in particular having read an article by Bill Gates in which he recommended <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-books-worth-reading-summer-bill-gates/" title="5 books worth reading this summer" target="_blank">5 summer reads</a> (you will notice another book in his recommendations that is listed later in my own list), with Origin Story being one of them. While the task of writing a history of "everything" is hardly a straightforward one, Christian does a very good job of being incredibly detailed, while keeping things simple.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2QAqGYw" title="Measure What Matters" target="_blank" id="MeasureWhatMatters">Measure What Matters: OKRs: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth - John Doerr:</a> We have been working on implementing OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) at <a href="http://www.decibelinsight.com" id="Decibel" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel</a> for a while now, and our team decided to take the lead and be the "guinea pig" for the rest of the company. Doerr's book does a great job of explaining how to implement, manage and track against these, while also giving some great insight into how these have been successful at numerous companies, including Google. While hardly a life-changing read, it certainly helped point me in the right direction when it comes to managing my team's OKRs more effectively.

<a href="https://amzn.to/37vdBXa" title="The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" target="_blank" id="TheSubtleArt">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life - Mark Manson:</a> I'm hardly one for reading self-help or motivational books, but I had been recommended this by a number of friends and colleagues, in what is perhaps a worrying insight into my stress levels. The book is light hearted and contains some useful tips, but there is a lot of repetition throughout and no real ground-breaking information. It's a nice read, but don't expect it to change your life.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SLBWnB" title="A Higher Loyalty" target="_blank" id="AHigherLoyalty">A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership - James Comey:</a> I was never fully aware of James Comey until the recent U.S. Presidential elections, when the then-FBI Director announced the re-opening of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation a few weeks before the election. Comey later joined the very long list of people fired by Donald Trump (if you add those fired on The Apprentice, the list just gets longer). I found this a really enjoyable and open read (as open as the book of a former FBI Director can be), with Comey talking about his career, famous events, but also mistakes and numerous challenges, in particular, Trump. While the truth of events between the two is open to debate, I really enjoyed reading the chapter regarding these events in particular, along with the rest of the book.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2FaSzRI" title="Everybody Lies" target="_blank" id="EverybodyLies">Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us about Who We Really Are - Seth Stephens-Davidowitz:</a> I began to read this after a presentation by Decibel CEO Ben Harris in one of our Company Meetings, where he presented a few alarming/funny stats that he had read in this book. This is a thoroughly interesting read that I would advise to anyone who works with data in any shape or form. A lot of the data comes from Google searches, with the first chapter showing an alarming link between racist searches and the election of Donald Trump. 

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MM2wZN" title="Fire and Fury" target="_blank" id="FireAndFury">Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House - Michael Wolff:</a> Continuing with the theme of U.S. politics (something that my knowledge is sufficiently lacking on) after the Comey book, I decided to give Michael Wolff's much publicised and debated work a read. While it is a common feeling that the current administration is a bit of a circus, this book is a scary insight into the current White House. An enjoyable read from cover to cover, even if some of the events make the book feel like a work of fiction.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2u7PCio" title="One Plus One Equals Three" target="_blank" id="OnePlusOneEqualsThree">One Plus One Equals Three: A Masterclass in Creative Thinking - Dave Trott:</a> I borrowed this book from a friend who highly recommended this, and read it at the same time as my fiancée, often resulting in one of us being disappointed because the other had picked it up first. We should probably get Kindles. This is a really quick and easy book to read, full of short (three to four page) stories about creative ways of thinking and famous examples, including the story of Django Reinhardt.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2QiGS1C" title="Factfulness" target="_blank" id="factfulness">Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About The World - And Why Things Are Better Than You Think - Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund:</a> This is another book taken from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-books-worth-reading-summer-bill-gates/" title="5 books worth reading this summer" target="_blank">Bill Gates list</a> that I mentioned previously. It is certainly an interesting read that looks to present a different world view to the reader, and does so successfully. One example comes in the form of plane crashes; e.g. it's entirely rational to be scared of flying because you read about accidents and crashes in the press, however these only report the incredibly small percentage that do occur out of the total number of flights that are successful every single day. The book certainly provides food for thought, but does become fairly repetitive and could probably come in shorter form.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MMYosw" title="Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?" target="_blank" id="AreWeSmartEnough">Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? - Frans De Waal:</a> De Waal takes us on a fascinating journey of his studies and research across many years and looks to ridicule human assumptions about animals. He makes valid points throughout the book, particularly about the fact that we are often so quick to compare animals and their behaviours to humans, in experiments that are often biased to us. The majority of De Waal's work is with chimpanzees, and this book includes some incredible stories regarding their motivation and behaviour, along with some hilariously misbehaving animals.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2QESVVX" title="Lost and Founder" target="_blank" id="LostAndFounder">Lost and Founder: A Painfully Honest Field Guide to the Startup World - Rand Fishkin:</a> Painfully honest is certainly one way of putting it. I've read quite a few books from founders of start ups that tend to be more instructional reads than honest stories, i.e. "do this" and "don't do that". Fishkin talks a lot about both successful and horrifying events during his time at Moz in what is a really refreshing read. The book, of course, does come with some advice to aspiring entrepreneurs, however also contains a surprising amount of financial information about Fishkin's time at Moz, including his salary. One of the final chapters touches on his battle with depression which results in him leaving his role as CEO, something that I have nothing but respect for Fishkin for talking about.

<a href="https://amzn.to/37oPb1w" title="What If?" target="_blank" id="WhatIf">What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions - Randall Munroe:</a> A very, very funny and educational read. As suggested in the title, Munroe takes absurd questions that have been shared to him and goes into detail to provide as true an answer as possible. Similar to One Plus One Equals Three, it's full of short chapters which make it an easy read, and contains humorous anecdotes throughout. There will certainly be some fun facts that you'll be sharing with friends and colleagues after reading.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2u537iP" title="This Is Going To Hurt" target="_blank" id="ThisIsGoingToHurt">This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor - Adam Kay:</a> This is another book that I had been recommended to read by multiple people, including my fiancée who read it shortly before me and ruined the ending for me. The role of any doctor is one that I have huge respect for, but even more so after reading this. Kay takes you on a hilarious, but sometimes scary, sad and worrying journey regarding the role of a Junior Doctor, including the ridiculous hours that they work. A book that is easy to read and will have you laughing out loud at times, while potentially making you want to cry in others.

<a href="https://amzn.to/37yu39l" title="Friend Request" target="_blank" id="FriendRequest">Friend Request - Laura Marshall:</a> As you can probably tell from the above list, I don't often read novels, and this was a quick reminder about why that is the case. Labelled as a "psychological thriller", this book is the story of someone that receives a friend request (the clue is in the title) from an old school friend who was believed to have vanished 25 years ago. The plot is rather slow to get going and sometimes not quite believeable, while the "big twist/reveal" then happens with quite a bit of the book still to read, which leaves the reader with nothing to do but tick off the missing points from the story. I'll stick to my usual books.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2QJNwwK" title="Shoe Dog" target="_blank" id="ShoeDog">Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of NIKE - Phil Knight:</a> I have been wanting to read this book ever since it came out two years ago, and feedback from a number of colleagues only heightened my wish to read the story of Nike from the company's founder. I had no idea about the humble beginnings of the Oregon based company which is now worth around $30 billion, including the fact that they originally operated as a distributor of Japanese shoes made by Tiger. Knight's memoirs are incredibly interesting, and touch on the difficulties that they faced during the initial years, including the constant battle to meet payments each month. The book takes you from the founding in 1964 through to going public in 1980, so while it doesn't touch on any of their recent successes, it is still a brilliant read and is one that I would highly recommend.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2SJf7AZ" title="Life 3.0" target="_blank" id="Life3.0">Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence - Max Tegmark:</a> Books on the future of life around artificial intelligence are not very hard to come by at the moment and seem to be a fairly hot topic. Tegmark's look into the future is very well written, both for those with no knowledge of AI and those with a working knowledge in the field, even enouraging those with knowledge to skip the first few chapters. Tegmark starts with a great story about "Prometheus", an AI tool that takes over the world, and constantly references this in examples throughout. The book gets quite heavy in the second half, but I would urge those that start to stick it out.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZJ4LT4" title="The Dark Net" target="_blank">The Dark Net - Jamie Bartlett:</a> I decided to read Jamie Bartlett's excellent account of the The Dark Net having watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3312868/" title="Deep Web" target="_blank">Deep Web</a> and Storyville's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7301126/" title="Silk Road: Drugs, Death and the Dark Web" target="_blank">Silk Road: Drugs, Death and the Dark Web</a>, two very interesting documentaries which mainly focus on 'Silk Road', described as 'the Amazon of illegal drugs'. Bartlett looks in depth at famous cases and uses of the Dark Net, but while obviously covering the negatives of a site like Silk Road, he also looks at where decentralized and encrypted platforms can be of benefit to society. A very interesting read, but certainly not for the faint-hearted.

<a href="https://amzn.to/36mQIVO" title="The People Vs Tech" target="_blank">The People Vs Tech: How the internet is killing democracy (and how we save it) - Jamie Bartlett:</a> I often try to move away from reading two books in a row on the same subject or by the same author, but having read Bartlett's excellent book "The Dark Web", I decided to read his more recent work in the form of The People Vs Tech. A well-informed book and one that may cause some surprise to those who don't have a broad knowledge on social media advertising and how politics and companies make use of people's data.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MQGchX" title="Thanks a lot Mr Kibblewhite" target="_blank">Thanks a lot Mr Kibblewhite: My Story - Roger Daltrey:</a> My final book of the year came in the form of The Who frontman Roger Daltrey's autobiography. Having been a fan of The Who for as long as I can remember, this was a really enjoyable and easy book to read, documenting their rise to fame along with the battles that came with it. Many have spoken about The Who's tour antics during their peak, and while this book touches on them from a first hand account, it's probably not in the detail you would be expecting, which was my only disappointment with this.
