### The Return Of The Start Menu: Windows 10 Unveiled

Microsoft unveiled <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/" target="_blank" title="Windows 10: The Next Chapter">Windows 10</a> on Tuesday in San Francisco, with the big news being that the upgrade would be free (ish) for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 users.

It’s safe to say that things didn’t go as expected for Microsoft when they released <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/Windows-8.1/categoryID.62684800" target="_blank" title="Windows 8">Windows 8</a>. The operating system was seen as a bit of a dud to many, particularly with the withdrawal of the Start Menu, one of the most recognisable features of Windows.

Microsoft claimed at the debut of <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/" target="_blank" title="Windows 10: The Next Chapter">Windows 10</a> that they had skipped over calling it Windows 9 because it "wouldn’t be right" given the importance. However, some have claimed that this is due to Windows 95 legacy code, which you can take a look at <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2690724/why-windows-10-isnt-named-9-windows-95-legacy-code.html" target="_blank" title="Why Windows 10 isn't named 9: Windows 95 legacy code?">here</a> and decide for yourself.

The new system will run across all Windows devices, and aims to give users a seamless transition whether working on a mobile, tablet or PC. Microsoft believe they have ironed out the creases that made Windows 8 a good OS on touch screen devices but not so much on those with a keyboard and mouse.

Windows 10 will come with a customisable Start Menu with live tiles, as can be seen in Karissa Bell's Vine <a href="https://twitter.com/karissabe/status/517015723789791233" target="_blank" title="Start menu in action in #Windows10">here</a>.

The big news that <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/" target="_blank" title="Windows 10: The Next Chapter">Windows 10</a> would be free will grab the headlines, although it is only for a year for users of Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. However, this is a smart move by Microsoft as it should help avoid a repeat of the slow uptake that Windows 8 saw. Microsoft believe that only around 10% of computers are running Windows 8, with that number even lower among companies. Pricing for Windows 10 hasn't been announced as of yet, and it will be intriguing to see what Microsoft value it at, and how users will be able to purchase it once their free year is up.

Other big new features included the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us" target="_blank" title="HoloLens">HoloLens</a>, an augmented reality headset and software system presented by Alex Kipman.

<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/cortana/meet-cortana" target="_blank" title="Cortana">Cortana</a> meanwhile, which I’m sure you will have seen from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0u_9LFxX_M" target="_blank" title="Cortana Happy Anniversary">Windows Phone adverts</a>, is also improved for Windows 10 with Microsoft's vice president of the operating systems group, Joe Belfiore, spending plenty of time in his demonstration showing off how "intelligent" the new Cortana will be.

It also looks like we might finally (finally!) be saying goodbye to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/internet-explorer/browser-ie#touchweb=touchvidtab1" target="_blank" title="Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>. Microsoft unveiled their brand new browser, currently called <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/01/21/microsoft-project-spartan-browser/" target="_blank" title="Project Spartan is Microsoft's new web browser for Windows 10">Project Spartan</a>, which is made for Windows 10 and features a new rendering engine and a clean and simple design.

Microsoft have announced its <a href="https://insider.windows.com/" target="_blank" title="Windows Insider Program">Windows Insider Program</a>, which is available now for users to get technical previews of <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/" target="_blank" title="Windows 10: The Next Chapter">Windows 10</a> and "help shape the future of Windows". I am currently eagerly awaiting the first technical preview to be available and will report back with a review shortly.
