### Nike To Release 'Back To The Future' Self-Tying Shoelaces This Year

There are 286 days left until October 21st 2015, the day that Marty McFly arrived in the future in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/" target="_blank" title="Back To The Future Part II IMDB">Back To The Future Part II</a> with Doc Brown and Jennifer Parker. One of the most popular "futuristic" inventions of that film, the Nike MAG Power Laces, will finally be released to the public this year, Nike's innovation chief Tinker Hatfield confirmed at a trade show in Long Beach, California, on Monday.

"Didn’t Nike already do this a few years ago?" I hear you ask. Alas, no. <a href="http://news.nike.com/news/1500-pairs-of-the-mythical-2011-nike-mag-shoes-will-be-auctioned-on-ebay" target="_blank" title="1,500 PAIRS OF THE MYTHICAL 2011 NIKE MAG SHOES WILL BE AUCTIONED ON EBAY">Nike made 1,500 kicks in 2011</a> that lit up like the ones in the film but replaced the laces with elastic, auctioning them off and raising $6 million, with the proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/" target="_blank" title="Michael J.

The ones that are due for release this year will include the lighting as well as the power laces. No official date has been set for release, but one can only assume it would be around the date that Marty first arrived in the future.

Nike aren’t the only ones who are trying to recreate the technology used in the film for power laces.

Blake Bevin had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blakebevin/power-laces" target="_blank" title="Power Laces Kickstarter">Kickstarter project</a> in 2010 after posting her designs online. These used an Arduino microcontroller and a pressure sensor in the sole which would detect when the trainer is being worn before tightening the laces using servo motors. Although it’s been a number of years since the Kickstarter project, Bevin remains hopeful that her company is looking to release this year.

It’s an exciting few months ahead for Back To The Future fans, with The Guardian recently running an excellent piece about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/02/what-back-to-the-future-part-ii-got-right-and-wrong-about-2015-an-a-z" target="_blank" title="What Back to the Future Part II got right and wrong about 2015 – an A-Z The Guardian">what Back To The Future II got right and wrong in its predictions for 2015</a>.

Meanwhile, remind yourself what all the fuss is about with the self-tying shoelaces scene from the 1989 movie below.
