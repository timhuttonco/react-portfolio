### Facebook's Hooli Moment Shows It Has A Long Way To Go

Facebook Live this week prepared for the highest of high profile tests in its young history as Buzzfeed looked set to host a live interview with none other than U.S. President Barack Obama. 

SPOILER ALERT: For those of you who have not seen Season 2 of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" title="Silicon Valley HBO" target="_blank">Silicon Valley</a>, I suggest skipping this paragraph and the next.

Those of you who have been following the Pied Piper v Hooli battle in the HBO show will reminisce of the scene where Hooli agree to a live stream of a UFC fight on their Nucleus platform, which does not go according to plan in the slightest. It’s safe to say that Facebook Live’s stream earlier this week had a similar result.

To set the scene, <a href="https://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> has been aggressively courting media publications to use its <a href="https://live.fb.com/" title="Facebook Live" target="_blank">Live video streaming feature</a>, with many marketers quick to jump on board. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" title="Buzzfeed" target="_blank">Buzzfeed</a> took up the offer, but in what was billed as the President’s "first interview on Facebook Live", the President’s face wasn’t seen once during the stream.

The feed began at 2:50pm with BuzzFeed legal editor Chris Geidner sitting alone to begin the feed and introduce the President, but by 2:55pm, the feed had stalled, and 35,000 viewers were left with nothing to see, prompting Buzzfeed to have to comment on the stream and direct users to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" title="YouTube" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

The failure will cause embarrassment for Facebook, who were keen to flex their live streaming muscles, and the fact that it worked flawlessly on YouTube, a big competitor to Facebook on the live-streaming circuit, will only add insult to injury.

Facebook have yet to comment on what caused the issue, and had reportedly put 150 engineers into the project, according to comments at the recent <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/04/15/facebook-live-news-outlets/#J6KlBUc1ePqq" title="Facebook Live is the next big thing in media" target="_blank">F8 conference</a>.

Live streaming is of course a huge challenge and one that is not to be underestimated, but fortunately for Facebook, their 1.6 billion monthly user base will keep marketing companies using the social network, just maybe not for high-profile live video streams.
