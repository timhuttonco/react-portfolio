### A Year In Books - 2024
Another year has passed, and with it, the time has come to compile my usual list of book reviews. Not only is it an insight into my reading list, and a chance to see a picture of my beloved Spaniel, but it’s also an insight into how productive I have started the year as I always aim to write this as early in the year as possible - some years have rather embarrassingly even stretched to a February publication. Thankfully I have done better this time around.

I have tried to change the format a bit this year to make it easier to digest, rather than the usual list in no particular order. I also found this year to be the first time in a while where my preference moved back to physical books and away from my beloved <a href="https://amzn.to/424CMj8" target="_blank" title="Amazon Kindle">Kindle</a>, although I have found this somewhat restrained my night reading!

<h4><i>Best Novel</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4fKNlL6" target="_blank" title="The Scarlet Papers - Matthew Richardson">The Scarlet Papers - Matthew Richardson</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 9/10</h6>
<p>Matthew Richardson's <a href="https://amzn.to/4fKNlL6" target="_blank" title="The Scarlet Papers - Matthew Richardson">The Scarlet Papers</a> is a thrilling and innovative spy novel and is my favourite novel of the year. It jumps between the present day, where a retired spy grapples with the past and the plan to publish her memoirs, and the past itself with the actual contents of the memoirs. It’s very cleverly written and is a fictional “addition” to the true story of Kim Philby and his defection to the Soviet Union, a topic that I had actually read a factual account of earlier in the year (more on that later).</p>

<h4><i>Best Non-Fiction</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4gRJ35W" target="_blank" title="The Places In Between - Rory Stewart">The Places In Between - Rory Stewart</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 8.5/10</h6>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4gRJ35W" target="_blank" title="The Places In Between - Rory Stewart">The Places In Between</a> is a captivating account of Rory Stewart’s remarkable journey across Afghanistan on foot. I’m a huge admirer of Stewart, and he masterfully provides vivid descriptions of his encounters with locals in remote villages, offering a glimpse into a world untouched by modernity. Interwoven with insightful historical context, this book provides a unique and deeply engaging perspective on Afghanistan, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.</p>

<h4><i>Notable novels</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/42iZTGP" target="_blank" title="Don’t Point That Thing At Me - Kyril Bonfiglioli">Don’t Point That Thing At Me - Kyril Bonfiglioli</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 8.5/10</h6>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/42iZTGP" target="_blank" title="Don’t Point That Thing At Me - Kyril Bonfiglioli">Don't Point That Thing at Me</a> is a hilarious and entertaining read following the art dealer Charlie Mortdecai that was later made into a <a href="https://amzn.to/3BMSiFD" target="_blank" title="Mortdecai">film</a>. The writing is superb, very much reminiscent of P.G. Wodehouse. Despite its hilarity, it is a captivating plot full of twists and turns throughout. While I'd seen the movie starring Johnny Depp previously, I didn’t recall it very well so it didn’t spoil the reading of this. One of my favourite lines in the book, which is used a few times and is something that I do myself and can now put a term to, is when Mortdecai writes “I read myself to sleep”.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/42iYjon" target="_blank" title="Salmon Fishing In The Yemen - Paul Torday">Salmon Fishing In The Yemen - Paul Torday</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 8/10</h6>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/42iYjon" target="_blank" title="Salmon Fishing In The Yemen - Paul Torday">Salmon Fishing In The Yemen</a> is a charming and unexpected delight. I was aware of the fact it had been made into a move but had never seen it. Told through a unique blend of letters, emails, and diary entries, the narrative unfolds in a surprisingly engaging way. While there are poignant moments, the overall tone is lighthearted and optimistic. This unconventional storytelling approach makes for a truly enjoyable and memorable reading experience.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3BX7v6W" target="_blank" title="The Museum Of Innocence - Orhan Pamuk">The Museum Of Innocence - Orhan Pamuk</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6>
<p>Pamuk’s novel is a tale depicting a member of one of Türkiye’s richest families falling obsessively in love with a shop-girl, set amidst the backdrop of 1970s Istanbul. Beautifully written, the novel intricately portrays the city's cultural shift towards Westernization during that time, particularly its impact on women. Pamuk's descriptions of Istanbul are captivating and have really made me want to visit. While the story is undoubtedly moving, its length could be significantly reduced without compromising the narrative or observations. The protagonist creates a "Museum of Innocence," which Pamuk himself <a href="https://channel.louisiana.dk/video/orhan-pamuk-presenting-the-museum-of-innocence" target="_blank" title="Orhan Pamuk Presenting The Museum of Innocence">went on to create</a> four years after publishing this book, as "a tribute to the unimportant daily life objects and their valuable meaning for our memory and connection with time lost."</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/420l5kx" target="_blank" title="Little Siberia - Antti Tuomainen">Little Siberia - Antti Tuomainen</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6>
<p>I remember spotting this book and reading its synopsis during a visit to my in-laws and impatiently waiting for them to finish it so that I could start. <a href="https://amzn.to/420l5kx" target="_blank" title="Little Siberia - Antti Tuomainen">Little Siberia</a> is a darkly comedic novel originally written in Finnish about a meteorite that strikes a small Finnish village, throwing the lives of its inhabitants into chaos. The story mixes this extraordinary event with the personal struggles of the main character, creating a compelling narrative that builds to a satisfying and unexpected climax. Rumour has it that it’s coming to Netflix in the near future.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3DH7WCW" target="_blank" title="A Fatal Crossing - Tom Hindle">A Fatal Crossing - Tom Hindle</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6>
<p>I had seen this book seemingly recommended everywhere, and it lived up to the hype. A captivating murder mystery, it kept me guessing throughout with a series of unexpected twists that unfolded right up until the final page. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of the genre. Very cleverly written.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4h0qJYd" target="_blank" title="Rules Of Civility - Amor Towles">Rules Of Civility - Amor Towles</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7.5/10</h6>
<p>Having thoroughly enjoyed Amor Towles's <a href="https://amzn.to/40okYhu" target="_blank" title="A Gentleman In Moscow- Amor Towles">A Gentleman In Moscow</a> (though I still lament its adaptation into a television series), I eagerly picked up his debut novel, <a href="https://amzn.to/4h0qJYd" target="_blank" title="Rules Of Civility - Amor Towles">Rules of Civility</a>. While not quite reaching the same heights as its predecessor, it retains the same warmth and elegance that made <a href="https://amzn.to/40okYhu" target="_blank" title="A Gentleman In Moscow- Amor Towles">A Gentleman In Moscow</a> so captivating. The story follows an ambitious young woman navigating the social ladder of 1930s New York. While not an action-packed thriller, <a href="https://amzn.to/4h0qJYd" target="_blank" title="Rules Of Civility - Amor Towles">Rules of Civility</a> is a delightful read.</p>

<h4><i>Notable non-fiction</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3W84IhU" target="_blank" title="Ask Me His Name: Learning to live and laugh again after the loss of my baby - Elle Wright">Ask Me His Name: Learning to live and laugh again after the loss of my baby - Elle Wright</a></h5>
<p>This is a truly beautiful book from a mother who lost her child three days after he was born. Wright tells the story of her pregnancy, the birth of her son Teddy, and what happens when parents leave a hospital without their newborn. It’s a heartbreaking read, which Wright somehow still manages to bring some humour to. She does raise a point which I entirely agree with that almost everyone who reads her book is either someone who has lost a child, or knows someone that does, and she wants to change that so miscarriage and stillborn is a topic that is openly discussed amongst all. Given the topic, it’s probably not right to be giving any sort of rating to this, all I will say, is read it.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4a2RgBY" target="_blank" title="Everything To Play For - James Harkin & Anna Ptaszynski">Everything to Play For: The QI Book of Sports - James Harkin & Anna Ptaszynski</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7/10</h6>
<p>Anyone who has listened to the <a href="https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/" target="_blank" title="No Such Thing As A Fish">No Such Thing As A Fish</a> podcast will know exactly what to expect from this book. Whilst sport might not be any of the hosts' strongest subject, as always, it is meticulously researched, containing really interesting facts, whilst maintaining the silly humour you would expect. A note that this has since been re-published in paperback as <a href="https://amzn.to/4h1ik6P" target="_blank" title="A Load Of Old Balls - James Harkin & Anna Ptaszynski">A Load Of Old Balls</a>.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3DR8O7Q" target="_blank" title="A Spy Among Friends - Ben Macintyre">A Spy Among Friends - Ben Macintyre</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7/10</h6>
<p>Anyone who has read any of my previous reviews will know that I’m a long-time admirer of Macintyre's work. Given Kim Philby's enduring presence in espionage literature, both fiction and non-fiction, this meticulously researched account is a welcome addition. Macintyre masterfully documents the life and career of Philby, drawing upon interviews with key figures to bring the story to life. The narrative centers on the complex relationship between Philby and Nicholas Elliott, highlighting a deeply troubling episode in British intelligence history that continues to resonate today. This book has also been adapted into a television series.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4a5b87u" target="_blank" title="The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read - Philippa Perry">The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read - Philippa Perry</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7/10</h6>
<p>This book had been on my reading list for some time, and I found it to be incredibly thought-provoking. It's a valuable resource not only for prospective parents but also for anyone seeking to better understand their own relationship with their parents. The book delves into the complexities of child development across all stages, from infancy to adulthood, and even explores the grandparent-grandchild dynamic. The inclusion of practical exercises further enhances its value, making it an insightful and engaging read.</p>

<h4><i>Other Novels</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4j1EYxA" target="_blank" title="The Crash - Robert Peston">The Crash - Robert Peston</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6/10</h6>
<p>This one can be somewhat challenging to read due to the ego of the main character, who essentially is a fictional version of Peston himself, someone who I have to say I’m not the biggest fan of. Despite this, the narrative is interesting, particularly for those who remember the 2008 financial crisis, which this is based off. Although it’s a sequel to <a href="https://amzn.to/3BYrRwy" target="_blank" title="The Whistleblower - Robert Peston">The Whistleblower</a>, it can be read as a standalone, although it will spoil the first book if you read it, something I found out a bit too late!</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4jehGF4" target="_blank" title="On Her Majesty's Secret Service - Ian Fleming">On Her Majesty's Secret Service - Ian Fleming</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 5.5/10</h6>
<p>I don't have much memory of watching this Bond film, and couldn’t resist the opportunity to finally read a Bond novel having never done so before. For reference - this is the one that's up in the mountains. Not a huge amount actually happens in the book, and obviously the main bits that do are fairly fatfetched, as is the case with most Bonds, but it's a fun read nonetheless, even just for the novelty.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4j4KOyw" target="_blank" title="How To Kill Your Family - Bella Mackie">How To Kill Your Family - Bella Mackie</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7/10</h6>
<p>I encountered this book everywhere – on advertisements and in the hands of fellow commuters – throughout the year, and I can now understand the hype. It's a truly entertaining read, blending humor and suspense with a series of unexpected twists. The novel features some truly ingenious (and darkly humorous) murders, making it a captivating and thoroughly enjoyable read.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4fIAXeH" target="_blank" title="Damascus Station - David McCloskey">Damascus Station - David McCloskey</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 7/10</h6>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4fIAXeH" target="_blank" title="Damascus Station - David McCloskey">Damascus Station</a> is a compelling spy thriller by a former CIA analyst that follows a case officer on a perilous mission in Syria. The novel offers a realistic and textured portrayal of the Syrian conflict, with the ongoing political turmoil serving as a gripping backdrop for the action - rather timely given the events in the country at the end of 2024. While the inclusion of a romantic subplot is somewhat predictable, it doesn't detract significantly from the overall impact. </p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3PjOqPs" target="_blank" title="A Beginner’s Guide To Breaking And Entering - Andrew Hunter Murray">A Beginner’s Guide to Breaking and Entering - Andrew Hunter Murray</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6>
<p>A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering is a very witty read and one that I certainly enjoyed. The story follows Al, who has perfected the art of living rent-free in luxurious homes while the owners are away. It’s a funny concept and I wish there were a few more chapters like the first one. The book does get a little bit tedious with the stereotypical romance angle as the book goes on, but that doesn’t take too much away from the enjoyment.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/424MZMf" target="_blank" title="Yellowface - Rebecca F Kuang">Yellowface - Rebecca F Kuang</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 5/10</h6>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/424MZMf" target="_blank" title="Yellowface - Rebecca F Kuang">Yellowface</a> seems to have been absolutely everywhere in the last year - there are not many readers that I know who have not read it. It has been on posters everywhere and in the front of every book store. Whilst I appreciate the exploration of themes of cultural appropriation and the publishing industry, I found the execution and storyline to be thoroughly underwhelming. The premise is intriguing, but I felt the novel was overly long and, from quite an early point, pretty predictable. </p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/422JLca" target="_blank" title="The Bee Sting - Paul Murray">The Bee Sting - Paul Murray</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 4/10</h6>
<p>Another hugely hyped book that was sorely disappointing. It tells the story of four family members from each of their perspectives, none of which are interesting at all, with far too much time spent on one character's backstory, which really isn't that relevant to the story. The lack of punctuation for the writing of one of the character's is almost unforgivable; I get that it’s supposed to be in keeping with the character themselves but it’s just annoying! Sadly I'm not one to give up a book after starting, something I should have done when I got the shock of thinking we were getting through the story only for my Kindle to tell me that I was only 30% of the way through. I saw the book in a bookstore the following day and it dawned on me quite how long a book it was!</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4h0WjFk" target="_blank" title="Murder on Lake Garda - Tom Hindle">Murder on Lake Garda - Tom Hindle</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6/10</h6>
<p>Murder on Lake Garda is an enjoyable read that begins with the murder itself, before jumping back in time and then skillfully unravelling the events leading up to it. While astute readers may be able to predict the culprit, the journey towards the resolution is engaging. Not as strong as Hindle's debut novel, <a href="https://amzn.to/3DH7WCW" target="_blank" title="A Fatal Crossing - Tom Hindle">A Fatal Crossing</a>, it remains a satisfying and entertaining mystery.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3BZg4hG" target="_blank" title="Moscow X - David McCloskey">Moscow X - David McCloskey</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6>
<p>Having read and enjoyed <a href="https://amzn.to/4fIAXeH" target="_blank" title="Damascus Station - David McCloskey">Damascus Station</a>, I felt compelled to read <a href="https://amzn.to/3BZg4hG" target="_blank" title="Moscow X - David McCloskey">Moscow X</a>, which is another enjoyable read. While not quite as good as his debut, this espionage thriller remains highly engaging. The story centers around a CIA operation to infiltrate the Russian government using assets in the country. While there’s not a huge amount of “action” that one might expect from a spy novel, there is lots of very clever spycraft. It's intriguing to speculate how much of this intricate world of espionage reflects McCloskey's own experiences as a former CIA officer.</p>

<h4><i>Other Non-Fiction</i></h4>
<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/41YpSD9" target="_blank" title="Leaders Eat Last - Simon Sinek">Leaders Eat Last - Simon Sinek</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6/10</h6>
<p>(Sarcasm warning) Apparently Sinek has spent some time with the Marine Corps. He’s never mentioned it, or I’ve never seen videos of it plastered over LinkedIn by influencers. I sometimes struggle with some of Sinek’s rhetoric, especially as there are not many examples of his own words and recommendations being done by himself. That being said, I did find this book useful, particularly before starting my new role at Kingfisher early in the year. Starting anywhere as a leader can often be a challenge and one you feel you have to get right early. Sinek talks a lot about the circle of safety, and points out the human factors in being a good leader, “people over profits”, and lots of points that I definitely agree with.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4fSrHod" target="_blank" title="The Kennedy Curse - James Patterson & Cynthia Fagen">The Kennedy Curse - James Patterson & Cynthia Fagen</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 4.5/10</h6>
<p>The Kennedy history has always been one that has intrigued me, typically due to the assassinations of Bobby and JFK. I spotted this in a bookshop so decided to have a read, although I didn’t actually realise that Patterson was the author until I started. I’m not entirely sure how he does it as there seems to be a new Patterson book out every month! He’s a great thriller writer, but when traversing into non-fiction, the old habits remain, and this book just tries too hard to be a thriller when it doesn’t need to be - the family story is interesting enough.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3DTyO2q" target="_blank" title="Men, Love & Birth - Mark Harris">Men, Love & Birth - Mark Harris</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6>
<p>Regardless of the rating I have given it. I will start this by saying that I do think every man who intends on, or already has, a child should read this book. I think there are far more useful resources out there, and a lot of the text is written in rather difficult to read and forced "lad" tone, but there is no arguing that the content is incredibly useful.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4a2ZZE9" target="_blank" title="Nemesis: The Battle for Japan, 1944–45 - Max Hastings">Nemesis: The Battle for Japan, 1944–45 - Max Hastings</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 5.5/10</h6>
<p>As a product of the British education system, my knowledge of Japan's role in World War II was limited. This book, my first encounter with Max Hastings's work (whose books I've often avoided due to their sheer size), proved to be a compelling read despite its length. Hastings's meticulous research is evident throughout, making this an insightful read, albeit a long one.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/402mpAR" target="_blank" title="The Spy Who Was Left Out In The Cold - Tim Tate">The Spy Who Was Left Out In The Cold - Tim Tate</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6>
<p>I do enjoy a good true spy story. The <a href="https://amzn.to/402mpAR" target="_blank" title="The Spy Who Was Left Out In The Cold - Tim Tate">Spy Who Was Left Out In The Cold</a> recounts the life and exploits of Michal Goleniewski, a Polish intelligence officer who defected to the West. The book delves into the valuable information he provided, while also highlighting the paranoia and suspicion that plagued the American intelligence community, driven by the fear of Goleniewski being a double agent. This account offers a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of Cold War espionage.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/41ZVkRh" target="_blank" title="Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon - Michael Lewis">Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon - Michael Lewis</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 5.5/10</h6>
<p>Like many others, I was stunned by the sudden collapse of FTX. Prior to the scandal, I had limited knowledge of the cryptocurrency exchange and its enigmatic founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Given the events, it's easy to imagine that Lewis couldn’t believe his luck, being asked to write about Bankman-Fried very shortly before everything seemed to go wrong. It’s an absorbing account of this extraordinary and still-unfolding story, as Bankman-Fried remains incarcerated and the full extent of the damage remains to be fully understood.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/4fKAecX" target="_blank" title="The Marches: Border Walks With My Father - Rory Stewart">The Marches: Border Walks With My Father - Rory Stewart</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6>
<p>Having read and enjoyed Stewart’s <a href="https://amzn.to/40nz0jh" target="_blank" title="Politics On The Edge - Rory Stewart">Politics On The Edge</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4gRJ35W" target="_blank" title="The Places In Between - Rory Stewart">The Places In Between</a> (see above), I decided to read another of his books in the form of <a href="https://amzn.to/4fKAecX" target="_blank" title="The Marches: Border Walks With My Father - Rory Stewart">The Marches</a>. This covers Stewart’s walks across the borderlands between England and Scotland. His father occasionally joins and the book includes plenty of warming stories about their relationship. As always with Stewart, it’s filled with interesting historical anecdotes, as he tries to learn more about the area surrounding Hadrian’s Wall. The Marches is divided into three books, with the first talking about Stewart’s relationship with his father as a child, and the third   covering the final years of his father’s life as he looked back on it. If I’m honest, book two is what brings the rating down of this one, with Stewart himself growing frustrated about how little he is able to learn from the region’s occupants.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/406MzlP" target="_blank" title="The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - Eckhart Tolle">The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - Eckhart Tolle</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 3/10</h6>
<p>I’ll be completely honest here, and say that I did not enjoy reading this at all. I went into this with an open mind, however, this was quickly smashed to bits with the repetitive and preachy nature of Tolle. I understand the context and aim of the book, but it just wasn't for me.</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3W3Ones" target="_blank" title="How They Broke Britain - James O'Brien">How They Broke Britain - James O'Brien</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 5.5/10</h6>
<p>I’ve never actually listened to a James O’Brien radio show before - like most, my exposure to him has been through short clips of him ranting about the state of politics, or shutting callers and guests down about their absurd views. There is a slight level of arrogance which I do find off putting about O’Brien, and there is still an air of that in this book. It’s a detailed and good read covering the recent events in British politics, so it can be quite a depressing read at times. I agree with lots of his points on Corbyn, but I’m not sure an entire chapter dedicated to him was required or just,</p>

<h5><a href="https://amzn.to/3PpAeEx" target="_blank" title="Marcelo Bielsa: The Foundation of Success at Leeds United - Salim Lamrani">Marcelo Bielsa: The Foundation of Success at Leeds United - Salim Lamrani</a></h5>
<h6>Rating: 6.5/10</h6>
<p>I have deliberately left this one to last as it’s probably the book least likely to be read by anyone reading this review. Everyone knows that my love of Leeds United will always try and find its way into this list, and I finally got hold of Lamrani’s account of the 2018/19 season, when he was Bielsa’s translator. It’s a great insight into what was an extraordinary year, although the writing style can be a little mundane, and is incredibly repetitive - there’s only so many times you read “Marcelo chose the following line up” before you skip over that part. Clearly Lamrani wanted a better ending to his book, despite United not winning promotion that year, so adds an additional chapter about the year after which rather unnecessarily talks about every result of the following season, despite him not being involved. The prologue, from Rafael Bielsa, sums up not not just the book, but Bielsa’s time at Leeds United and how I related to football during that period. “This is a book about football. But reading it amounts to more than just reading about football.”</p>

I hope you enjoy the above, and as always, I am incredibly eager to hear any reading recommendations that you may have.
