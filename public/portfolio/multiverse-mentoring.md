### Multiverse Mentoring

<a href="https://www.multiverse.io/" target="_blank" title="Multiverse">Multiverse</a> are building an outstanding alternative to university and corporate training via professional apprenticeships. 

I have recently had the privilege of being part of the <a href="https://community.multiverse.io/page/the-mentoring-programme" target="_blank" title="Multiverse Mentoring Program">Multiverse Mentoring Program</a> where I have been fortunate enough to mentor two brilliant and driven apprentices on the <a href="https://www.multiverse.io/en-GB/programmes/advanced-data-fellowship-whole" target="_blank" title="Advanced Data Fellowship">Advanced Data Fellowship</a>. It has been a fantastic experience and one that I would definitely recommend that anyone, particular those in leadership positions or more advanced in their career, partake in.

Mentoring, both formally and informally, is so crucial to development. I have been fortunate enough to have some fantastic mentors across a variety of fields and seniority levels throughout my career, and I hope that I am able to take those learnings to continuously help others.

I was also asked to talk about my career, how mentors have shaped it, and my Multiverse Mentoring experience as part of their National Mentoring Day celebration in October 2022.
