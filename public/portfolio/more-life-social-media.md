### MoreLife: Social Media

My role as Social Media &amp; Digital Content Intern at child weight management company <a href="http://www.more-life.co.uk" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a> required me to manage their social media networks. Originally a summer internship that was extended to fit around my final year university studies due to the contribution I had made to the company’s social media presence, I was able to manage my time effectively between this role and my university studies.

The company had profiles on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoreLifeUK" target="_blank" title="MoreLife Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/team_morelife" target="_blank" title="MoreLife Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/morelife-uk-ltd-" target="_blank" title="MoreLife LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, and it was my job to ensure that these were managed and grown correctly, ensuring that timely and appropriate content was added to these networks, while also ensuring any wall posts or messages were responded to swiftly and appropriately.

Monthly reports were also compiled to monitor progress across the various networks, using tools such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/insights/tools/audience-insights?ref=ens_rdr" target="_blank" title="Facebook Audience Insights">Facebook Audience Insights</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>, while the role also required updating of the <a href="http://www.more-life.co.uk" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife website</a> using the site’s bespoke Content Management System.
