### Sportplan: Content and Marketing

My first role after graduating from <a href="http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="Leeds Metropolitan University">Leeds Metropolitan University</a> was an exciting one, working as part of the small team that made up <a href="http://sportplan.com/" target="_blank" title="Sportplan">Sportplan</a>, an online resource for coaches of various sports.

In this role I was required to research and produce video and written content on a daily basis, while also contributing to building and updating the company’s bespoke Content Management System which was used upload content, as well as using my HTML skills to produce various weekly emails to be sent to users.

I would then report on these emails, which were sent through email marketing software <a href="http://www.aweber.com/" target="_blank" title="AWeber">AWeber</a>, using <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> to see where they could be improved. I was responsible for all content that was added to the site.

My line manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=68859303&amp;authToken=HShU" target="_blank" title="Alex Blackman">Alex Blackman</a> kindly gave me the following recommendation on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timmyhutton" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>:
> "I had the pleasure of being Tim's line manager for a year at Sportplan. During this time he proved himself to be a hard working and valuable member of the team. Tim quickly learned how to prepare targeted email campaigns, in addition to bringing his existing video editing and copywriting skills to improve Sportplan's marketing and on site tutorials. I would highly recommend Tim, and believe he would be an asset to any team."
