### Implementation Engineer Manager EMEA at Tealium
#### February 2020 - August 2021

My role as Manager of the Implementation Engineering team at <a href="https://tealium.com/" title="Tealium" target="_blank">Tealium</a> involved the management of 12 highly-skilled remote Implementation Engineers based across the EMEA region who work closely with Tealium's clients to ensure a successful implementation of the Tealium suite of products, including the <a href="https://tealium.com/products/tealium-iq-tag-management-system/" title="Tealium iQ Tag Manager" target="_blank">Tealium iQ Tag Manager</a>, its server-side counterpart <a href="https://tealium.com/products/tealium-eventstream/" title="Tealium EventStream" target="_blank">EventStream</a>, and <a href="https://tealium.com/products/audiencestream/" title="Tealium AudienceStream" target="_blank">AudienceSteam</a>, a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

The role involved ensuring that our implementations were completed to the highest standard using best practices and global alignment, along with working closely with the Project Management team to ensure these were completed on time and on budget. This included making use of a deployment best practice scoring that was used by implementation teams globally and involved a strong reliance on documentation contribution from all team members.

One of my first tasks upon arriving at <a href="https://tealium.com/" title="Tealium" target="_blank">Tealium</a> was to undertake a review of the project management platforms being used by deployment teams, which resulted in the smooth transition and alignment of all global teams to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" title="JIRA">JIRA</a>. I was also responsible for ensuring Implementation Engineers achieved their KPIs and worked closely with the team on personal projects.
