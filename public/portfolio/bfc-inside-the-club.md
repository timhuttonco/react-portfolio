### Bromley FC: Inside The Club

Inside The Club was aseries of documentary style videos created during my time at <a href="http://www.bromleyfc.tv/new" target="_blank" title="Bromley Football Club">Bromley Football Club</a>, in addition to the already provided <a href="../portfolio/bromley-fc-media" target="_blank" title="BFCtv">media content</a>.

These videos would typically be released on a weekly basis towards the end of the week and in the build up to weekend fixtures. Typical content would focus on day-to-day events at the club both in regards to the playing squad and backroom staff, along with special features such as a tour of <a href="http://bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Bromley Arena">Bromley Arena</a> and its upcoming plans. These would provide additional insight and engagement for supporters, while also enabling additional sponsor exposure.

The final, and most popular, video in the series was a special edition from the F.A. Cup Fourth Qualifying Round game against Evesham United, a game Bromley won 2-1 to reach the First Round of the F.A. Cup. That video can be seen at the top of this article, while the full playlist can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKwtLLzprS5Lxc3-ZyF2n1F2fqEqsyvtV" target="_blank" title="Inside The Club">here.</a>
