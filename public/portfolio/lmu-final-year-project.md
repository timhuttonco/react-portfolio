### Leeds Metropolitan University: PHP Social Networking Project

<p>The final year of my BSC (Hons) Computing degree at <a href="http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="Leeds Metropolitan University">Leeds Metropolitan University</a> <a href="http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/education/a-new-term-and-a-new-name-for-leeds-beckett-university-1-6853221" target="_blank" title="A new term and a new name for Leeds Beckett University">(now Leeds Beckett University)</a> required me to develop a product for a client.

During this time I was working as Social Media &amp; Digital Content Intern for child weight management company <a href="../portfolio/more-life-social-media" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a>. With this in mind, <a href="http://more-life.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a> became my client for the project and I developed a social networking site for those that have taken part in a <a href="http://more-life.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a> program.

The site was built using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Ajax. Due to the fact that it would be used by young people, security was a big factor in the project. Users who signed up could not access the site until they were activated by an administrator, and they could only be friends with other users from their own localised program, so restrictions had to be put in place to prevent visibility of profiles.

Features of the site included: 
* Ajax registration and login
* Account activation required by administrators
* User profile page with info and status updates
* 'Wall' for posts from friends
* Ability to friend, unfriend and block users
* Ajax photo upload and albums
* Notifications 
* Cron jobs were also used for regular database clean up
