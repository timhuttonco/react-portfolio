As Service Delivery Lead, I was responsible for overseeing all client implementations. This predominantly involved managing a global team of Solutions Engineers based in London, Madrid and Denver, USA, and ensuring all implementations were successful and reached acceptable closure. I was required to create, review and update <a href="../portfolio/decibel-implementation" title="Decibel Implementation Processes" target="_blank">implementation processes and documentation</a>, along with communicating these efficiently to Service Delivery team members and relevant stakeholders throughout the company.

During this time, Decibel continued to expand and raised <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/decibel-raises-%2417m-series-b-funding-20191121" title="Decibel Raises $17 Million in Series B Funding Round" target="_blank">$17m in Series B funding in 2019</a>.

> *"I had the great opportunity to work with Tim as my Lead Solution Engineer at Decibel. He has the kindest and most patient way of teaching everything that he knows. He was the busiest person in the company but always had time for helping out and sharing his knowledge. His dedication and passion for the workplace were unquestionable. One of the few great bosses that I ever had."* - Gianfranco Franzella, Decibel

The role required the ability to proactively analyse implementations in order to focus on improvements, along with conducting post-implementation reviews. I was responsible for the full life-cycle of an implementation and fulfilling the requirements of clients' Success Plan, while also being a top-level escalation point for Solutions Engineers, Technical Support Analysts and Customer Success Managers.

Finally, the Service Delivery Lead role included developing and writing job specifications, hiring for new roles and adapting to hiring conditions in different regions, as well as career ladders, appraisals and OKRs for existing team members.
