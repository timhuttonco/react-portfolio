### Decibel Insight Webinars

During my time as a <a href="https://www.decibel.com/" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel</a> <a href="../portfolio/decibel-se" target="_blank" title="Decibel Solutions Engineer">Solutions Engineer</a>, I was asked to take part in a number of <a href="https://decibel.com/webinar-series/" target="_blank" title="Decibel Webinars">webinars</a> in partnership with our marketing team, covering topics such as conversion funnels and exploring the use of multichannel. 

In the role of Solutions Engineer, and later Senior Solutions Engineer, I was able to provide the relevant technical and product knowledge to attendees of the webinar, both as part of the webinar presentation and during questions at the end regarding how-tos and implementation.

Along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philhaslehurst" target="_blank" title="Head of Marketing Phil Haslehurst">Head of Marketing Phil Haslehurst</a>, in <a href="https://www.decibel.com/" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel's</a> first webinar of the year we discussed why conversion funnels are an effective tool for mapping the way visitors move through your website, and understanding where they abandon the process.

Used effectively, they become part of a website optimization process that increases customer satisfaction and improves return on investment. 

In this webinar we explored Decibel's intuitive Conversion Funnel features, explaining how they work, how to deploy them, and how they lead to deeper analysis of user behavior.

Following the successful Conversion Funnels Webinar at the start of the year, I was again asked to take part in a <a href="https://www.decibel.com/" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel</a> webinar as part of my role as Senior Solutions Engineer. This time, the subject being covered was why businesses struggled with multichannel, and how Decibel could help them make the most of it.

Joining Marketing Executive <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-jones-79281331" target="_blank" title="Lucas Jones Marketing Executive at Decibel Insight">Lucas Jones</a>, we discussed how you could go about stitching together customer interactions and start to build a single view of your customers, as well as exploring the challenges of multichannel in more detail in our exclusive webinar.
