### CN English Website

<a href="http://www.cnenglish.co.uk" target="_blank" title="CN English">CN English</a> is a Leeds-based English language teaching business led by Chris Holsman, who I have had the pleasure of working with previously when creating the <a href="../portfolio/impact-volunteering" target="_blank" title="Impact Volunteering">Impact Volunteering website</a>.

CN English helps English language learners improve their English language skills, in the areas of speaking, conversation and pronunciation. Lessons are provided online and face-to-face, and aim to make learning English an enjoyable and rewarding experience for you, and help you make the progress you desire.

Having worked with Chris previously, I was approached to design and build a website that would showcase CN English to prospective students. This included providing information on lessons, prices, testimonials and a contact form for prospective students to get in touch.

> *Tim did an excellent job updating and transforming my website. He worked quickly and efficiently and had my site live in no time at all. He kept in touch every step of the way and I am very pleased with the result."* - Chris Holsman, Founder of CN English
