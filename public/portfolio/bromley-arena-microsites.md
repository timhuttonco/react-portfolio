### Bromley Arena Microsites

As part of the re-brand of the stadium at <a href="http://www.bromleyfc.tv" target="_blank" title="Bromley Football Club">Bromley Football Club</a> into the Bromley Arena, six microsites were created for the various different sections, including Bromley Soccer Centre, Ravens Bar & Grill and Playzone.

The microsites were created using <a href="https://wordpress.com/" title="WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to enable straightforward and regular updates for the marketing and events team. 

A bespoke <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes" title="WordPress Theme" target="_blank">WordPress theme</a> was also created and used across all of the microsites to achieve consistency as part of these venues coming under one brand. The theme included full-screen slideshows to fully display key features of each venue, along with featuring information on each part of the arena such as upcoming events, prices, directions and simple to use contact forms.
