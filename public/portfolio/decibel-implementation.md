### Decibel Implementation Processes

During my time in various roles including <a href="../portfolio/decibel" target="_blank" title="Service Delivery Lead - Decibel">Service Delivery Lead</a> and <a href="../portfolio/decibel-se" target="_blank" title="Senior Solutions Engineer - Decibel">Senior Solutions Engineer</a> at customer-experience analytics platform <a href="https://decibel.com" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel</a>, I was required to create and continuously improve the implementation process that clients would go through.

Having created the <a href="../portfolio/decibel-support" target="_blank" title="Decibel Support">support processes</a> that were used with great success by clients, the next step in building a global and best-in-class Service Delivery team was to create proactive and consistent implementation processes, working closely with the <a href="https://decibel.com/customer-success/" target="_blank" title="Decibel Customer Success">Customer Success team</a> in both EMEA and the USA to ensure clients got off to the best possible start in their experience with Decibel. These processes resulted in Decibel receiving full-marks of 10 for their implementation score on <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/decibel-insight/" title="Predictive Analytics Today" target="_blank">Predictive Analytics Today</a>.

This began by reviewing existing implementations and reviewing the typical time it would take to implement various features, reviewing which features were implemented the most versus those that are used less, and using support ticket data to analyse where clients had the biggest pain-points when using and implementing Decibel. From this, the initial testing and checks were created, which were given the name of *pre-flight checks*. These involved testing key parts of the relevant journeys on a clients websites and the technologies behind them to review what would be required to result in a successful implementation. These steps were documented with an easy-to-follow process so that Solutions Engineers could know where to start and what to look out for as these checks progressed, along with being constantly iterated as team members encountered anything new.

Originailly documented in the Decibel support ticketing portal, these checks and all relevant documentation eventually moved to their own dedicated resource, along with using <a href="https://www.gainsight.com/" title="Gainsight: The Customer Success Company" target="_blank">Gainsight</a> to effectively track the progress and success of projects. A further development saw the creation of detailed and templated Implementation Guides, which Solutions Engineers could easily manage and tailor to the clients websites, requirements, and deployment methods, including using Tag Managers such as <a href="https://tealium.com/" title="Tealium" target="_blank">Tealium</a>, <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/tag-manager/" title="Google Tag Manager" target="_blank">Google Tag Manager</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/experience-platform/launch.html" title="Adobe Launch" target="_blank">Adobe Launch</a>. The same was created for QA checks which would be completed once a client had deployed to their website. These documents helped make it clear when any tasks were required to be created or amended, along with where on the relevant website these would need to be done.

> "The deployment was incredibly simple and the seamless integration with mainstream analytics and A/B testing tools was a real plus. Decibel also boasts an enthusiastic, knowledgeable and dedicated team, which really made the difference when deciding on a CX analytics partner." - <a href="https://decibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Decibel_Insight_Case_Study_River_Island.pdf" title="River Island Decibel Case Study" target="_blank">James Mitchell, River Island</a>

Internally, the Service Delivery team created an extension to easily help debug issues and observe data flow which was used by both Technical Support and Solutions Engineers. This created the ability to proactively test deployments before a client had implemented the tracking code on their website, along with allowing Technical Support to debug and resolve issues quicker. The extension was constantly iterated to take into account new features and new items that were required as part of implementations. This eventually led to the extension being released for public use, and thoroughly documented so that clients could easily implement and test features themselves *(an example of this output can be seen in the header image of this article, which is taken from <a href="https://knowledgebase.decibelinsight.com/articles/783-single-page-application-tracking#testing-trackpageview" title="Testing Single Page Application Tracking Decibel" target="_blank">the Decibel Knowledgebase</a>)*, resulting in a quicker time to go-live.

Additional documentation included public testing guides, implementation prerequisites and best practices which would be shared with clients at the start of implementations, ensuring they had all of the relevant information required to prepare for a successful implementation. With the hiring of Decibel's first ever Success Planner, we were also able to work on documented Success Plans which would be used during the sales process to ensure a seamless transition from sales to implementation, again decreasing time to go-live.

Internally, Implementation Review documents were created for all deployments, and these were "live" documents that were continuously amended throughout the deployment to include all relevant dates, and relevant feedback from all internal stakeholders throughout the course of the implementation, such as what Decibel can do better internally, any hold-ups on either the client or our side and other points. These would be continuously amended and then reviewed at project close as part of continuously iterating the implementation process.

Finally, it was also important to ensure that there was awareness throughout the company of the importance of implementation. This required the regular presenting of the implementation process to all teams and new hires as part of their onboarding process so that they could gauge the level of effort required to implement, and the importance of relevant checks.
