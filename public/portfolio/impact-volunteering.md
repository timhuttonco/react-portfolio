### Impact Volunteering Website

Impact Volunteering was a brand new Community Interest Company formed in April 2012, based in Leeds. After 14 years of managing volunteers with two large national charities, Chris Holsman has experienced how people’s lives have been transformed through volunteering and wanted to build a bespoke, more personalised quality service for both those needing help and those wanting to volunteer in a social care environment: and so, Impact Volunteering was born.

Having been approached by the client to develop the Impact Volunteering website, a number of meetings took place to agree content and design before the work started. They requested for the site to be built using WordPress so that they could easily maintain it once it had been created.

The website itself contained drop down menus, easily viewable contact information, a contact form and a front page slide show. Prospective volunteers could use the online application form or download an application form that I created at the request of the client. I also built a simple to follow manual that they could use to ensure that the website was maintained.

Founder and Operations Director Christopher Holsman left the following testimonial: "Tim designed my company website. He offered a first rate, professional service at a very reasonable price. He worked quickly and efficiently and I was impressed with his attention to detail and ability to meet deadlines. Communication throughout the project was excellent. Tim has also been very willing to help me with a number of other IT tasks; I have found him to be extremely approachable and helpful and the service he provides is of the highest standard. I will continue to rely on him for future work. I thoroughly recommend his services."
