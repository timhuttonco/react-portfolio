### Decibel Support Processes

As the first customer-facing technical resource at customer-experience analytics platform <a href="https://decibel.com" target="_blank" title="Decibel">Decibel</a>, I was responsible for the creation of the support processes and platforms that were used to support our growing customer base. 

What started as a one-person support team eventually grew to an 18-person Service Delivery organisation operating in London, Madrid and Denver, USA, incorporating <a href="../portfolio/decibel-support" target="_blank" title="Decibel Support Processes">technical support</a>, <a href="../portfolio/decibel-implementation" target="_blank" title="Decibel Implementation Processes">implementation</a>, pre-sales and technical account management functions, as Decibel continued to expand and raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/decibel-insight/" title="Decibel Insight scores $9M Series A for ‘digital experience analytics’ tech" target="_blank">$9m in Series A funding in 2017</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005453/en/Decibel-Raises-17-Million-in-Series-B-Funding-Round" title="Decibel Raises $17 Million in Series B Funding Round" target="_blank">$17m in Series B funding in 2019</a>.

Part of my role included helping to create the first support processes and ticketing system, which was created in-house and embedded into the Decibel platform. This provided direct access for users to raise bugs, ask for assistance and also raise feature requests which would be reviewed and fed to the Product team. Queries would also be raised as product requests based on the regularity of questions or issues.

A huge emphasis was given to documentation while creating the support processes. This eventually led to the creation of the <a href="../portfolio/decibel-knowledgebase" target="_blank" title="Decibel Knowledgebase">Decibel Knowledgebase</a>, a public facing repository of documentation on implementation and usage of the Decibel platform, while an internal team Wiki was also created to document support processes and escalations, along with providing information on how to debug issues and general rules of communication. Documentation was also added to the support workflow as a huge emphasis was placed on knowledge sharing, ensuring that internal and public documentation was updated when required based on new tickets, information or releases, along with the regular addition of detailed and commented code examples.

With the organisation, and with it the Service Delivery team, continuing to scale, it was important to ensure that support processes were efficient both for the size of the team at the time, and for when it would grow. This included adding features such as:

* Ticket claiming and assignment
* Automatic subscribing for Account Manager/Customer Success Managers
* Mentioning other users in tickets
* Automatic addition of screen capture and JSON file of filters used at time of raising ticket (below) - *this was a huge step forward in improving ticket resolution time as it never required a support team member to go back to a client asking for date ranges, filters, features being used etc.*
* Integration of support metrics for each client into Customer Success Platform <a href="https://www.gainsight.com/" title="Gainsight: The Customer Success Company" target="_blank">Gainsight</a>
* Internal ticket dashboard indicating tickets that needed responding, ticket assignment, SLA response time warnings and associated JIRA status
