### Bromley Arena Website

Fully responsive website built for newly branded <a href="http://bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Bromley Arena">Bromley Arena</a>, the home of <a href="http://www.bromleyfc.tv" target="_blank" title="Bromley Football Club">Bromley Football Club</a>, <a href="http://ravens.bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Ravens Bar and Grill">Ravens Bar and Grill</a>, <a href="http://thevenue.bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="The Venue">The Venue</a>, <a href="http://soccercentre.bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Bromley Soccer Centre">Bromley Soccer Centre</a> and <a href="http://playzone.bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Playzone">Playzone</a>.

The custom-built website was originally intended simply as a landing page, with two rows of three columns displaying the six logos of the facilities that lie within the Bromley Arena, linking to their <a href="../portfolio/bromley-arena-microsites" title="Bromley Arena Microsites" target="_blank">microsites</a>.

It was then requested that <a href="http://bromleyarena.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Bromley Arena">bromleyarena.co.uk</a> become a functioning website, not only linking to the microsites but also promoting what Bromley Arena is and how to find it, as well as displaying upcoming events and a contact page.

I stuck with the columned layout while adding a menu to the side. The site was made fully responsive, with an optimised menu for mobile. For the other pages of the site, design was inspired by a "Facebook Cover Photo" style layout.
