### MoreLife Videos

During my time as Social Media &amp; Digital Content Intern at child weight management company <a href="http://more-life.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a>, I was required on a number of occasions to create various videos for the company.

These would include promotional videos, interviews with children and parents who had been successful on the programme and features with company founder Paul Gately, discussing news and press releases.

Despite being based in Leeds, I was required to travel around the country to meet those at <a href="http://more-life.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a> clubs, and not only film their interviews, but also film the session that they were taking part in and mix this footage in with the interview using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere.html" target="_blank" title="Adobe Premiere Pro">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>.

A selection of my work during my time at <a href="http://more-life.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="MoreLife">MoreLife</a> can be seen in the playlist above, or by clicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpPPkNKFEUQ&amp;list=PLKwtLLzprS5IIh3n2IuoCt1YFKd0u-hkC" target="_blank" title="MoreLife YouTube Playlist">here</a>.
