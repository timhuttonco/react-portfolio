### Bromley FC Programme

During my time as Media &amp; Communications Editor at <a href="http://www.bromleyfc.tv" target="_blank" title="Bromley Football Club"> Bromley Football Club</a>, one of my responsibilities included both the design and content of the club's matchday programme, a printed publication that is sold to supporters on a matchday.

The programme was created predominantly using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html" target="_blank" title="Adobe InDesign"> Adobe InDesign</a>, and included regular content such as match reports, previews, exclusive player interviews, directions to upcoming away games and contributions from supporters. This was also an opportunity to showcase and provide additional exposure to club sponsors.
